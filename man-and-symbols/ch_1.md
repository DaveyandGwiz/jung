Sysmbols are the product of unconscious production, unlike signs.
Reliogious symbols are chiefly collective.
Collectiive sysmbols have their root in primeval dreams and fantasies.
Symbols are both individual and collective.
Jung's tory of conflict with freud.
Freud looked for a disgusied wish, while Jung saw the dream as a story of his psychic development.
Jung sees Freud's mmethod as too imposing and not listening to the individual.
"The individual is the only reality"

- The Problem of Types

Analysis occurs between two personalities.
Aggreenment and disagreement are both healthy withon bounds.
Dreams are interpreted on an individual basis, but indivicuals fall into types that 
can shed light on how to make sense of material.
Basic types are introversion and extraversion.
Differences between types can cause clashes in the process.
Extraverts accept majority views.
Introverts are apt to reject majority opinions.

    Sensation (i.e. sense-perception) tells you that something exists;
    thinking tells you what it is; 
    feeling tells 
    you whether it is agreeable or not; 
    and intuition tells you whence it comes and where it is going.

* thinking vs feeling
    feeling: value judgements made on an emotional level in response to situation eg. good or bad. It is an ordering function.
    thinging: rational thought when attempting to adapt to circumstances
* sense vs intuition
    Sense perception conscious
    unconscious sense perception

Dreams compensate for deficiences or distortions in the conscious mind.
/// but what constiitues a deficency or distortion?
The vague analogous forms dreams take is due to how material is stored in the unconscious.
It isnt a disguise.
dreams symbols are manifestations of the psyche outside of conscious control.
They are biological processes, psychic growth.
Dreams can be products of content that is neglected or repressed, these aare not true insticts.
Repression mechanisms overlay the normal unc. processes and distort its contents.
its is hard to integrate painful content.
Slow process to build trust before patient was ready to share feelings of inferiority.


- The Archetype in Dream Symbolism

Archaic remnants in dreams are not products of lived experience necessarily.
These are deeper in origin than personal associations.
Archaic images are primal mental organs.
An archetype is a tendency to form representations of a motif or instictive trend.
There are many motifs of the hero or hostile brethern in myth.
CHildren may brings dreams containing noticible images and motifs.
This seems to suggest an instictual or inherent blueprint of the mind that contains certain motifs.
Archetypal images are inhereted thought patterns.
an Archetype may influence a dream and provide an intepretation of life in symbolic form.
Archetypes come and go as they please, influencing consciousness ad-hoc (upon activation which is self determined).
An archetype is a complex on a large scale, serving to influence our conscious thought patterns and energies.
// How is this? So the archetype of the hero is more than a symbol appearing in dreams but some how has agency to influence conscious thought and deliberation? Or is it that the experience in dream of the hero archetype leaves a lasting effect on consciousness?
In Jung's example the story of Christ (the god-man type) invokes in us a set of thought p[atters] and identification with the hero figure which bring rise to changes in attitude or behavior? How does any sort of identification take place? THrough hero worship? Is that identification?
