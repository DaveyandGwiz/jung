Man and his Symbols conceived and edited by Carl G.Jung The first and only work in which Carl G. Jung, the world-famous Swiss psychologist, explains to the general reader his greatest contribution to our knowledge of the human mind: the theory of the importance of symbolism—particularly as revealed in dreams. Man and his Symbols Carl G.Jung But for a dream, this book would never have been written. That dream — described by John Freeman in the Foreword—convinced Jung that he could, indeed should, explain his ideas to those who have no special knowledge of psychology. At the age of eighty-three, Jung worked out the complete plan for this book, including the sections that he wished his four closest associates to write. He devoted the closing months of his life to editing the work and writing his own key section, which he completed only ten days before his death. Throughout the book, Jung emphasizes that man can achieve wholeness only through a knowledge and acceptance of the unconscious—a knowledge acquired through dreams and their symbols. Every dream is a direct, personal, and meaningful communication to the dreamer—a communication that uses the symbols common to all mankind but uses them always in an entirely individual way, which can be interpreted only by an entirely individual key.

So let me tell you just how it came to be written. O n e da y in the spring of 1959 the British Broadcasting Corporation invited me to interview for British television Dr. Carl Gusta v Jung . The interview was to be don e "in depth. " I knew little enough a t tha t time about Jun g an d his work, an d I at once went to mak e his acquaintance at his beautiful lakeside home nea r Zurich. Tha t was the beginning of a friendship tha t mean t a grea t deal to me and , I hope , gave some pleasure to Jun g in the last years of his life. Th e television interview has no further plac e in this story, except tha t it was accounted successful and tha t this book is by an odd combinatio n of circumstance s an endproduct of tha t success. O n e ma n wh o saw Jun g on the screen was Wolfgang Foges, manag - ing director of Aldus Books. Foges ha d been keenly interested in the development of moder n psychology since his childhood, whe n he lived near the Freuds in Vienna . An d as he watche d Jun g talking abou t his life and work an d ideas, Foges suddenly reflected wha t a pity it was that, while the genera l outline of Freud's work was well known to educated readers all over the Western world, Jun g ha d never manage d to break throug h to the genera l publi c an d was always considered too difficult for popula r reading. Foges, in fact, is the creator of Man and his Symbols. Havin g sensed from the T V screen tha t a warm personal relation existed between Jun g and myself, he asked me whethe r I would join him in trying to persuade Jun g to set out some of his mor e importan t an d basic ideas in language an d a t a length tha t would be intelligible an d interesting to non-specialist adult readers. I jumpe d at the idea an d set off once mor e to Zurich, determine d tha t I could convince Jun g of the value and importance of such a work. Jun g listened to me in his garde n for two hours almost withou t interruptio n — an d then said no. H e said it in the nicest possible way, bu t with grea t firmness; he ha d never in the past tried to populariz e his work, an d he wasn't sure tha t he could successfully d o so now ; anyway , he was old an d rathe r tired an d not keen to take on such a long commitmen t abou t which he had so man y doubts. Jung's friends will all agre e with me tha t he was a ma n of most positive decision. H e would weigh u p a problem with care an d without 9 hurry ; but whe n he did give his answer, it was usually final. I returned to Londo n greatly disappointed, but convinced tha t Jung's refusal was the end of the matter. So it might have been, but for two intervening factors tha t I had not foreseen. O n e was the pertinacity of Foges, who insisted on makin g one mor e approac h to Jun g before accepting defeat. Th e othe r was an event that, as I look back on it, still astonishes me . T h e television program was, as I have said, accounted successful. It brough t Jun g a grea t man y letters from all sorts of people, man y of them ordinar y folk with no medical or psychological training, wh o had been captivated by the commandin g presence, the humor, an d the modest charm of this very grea t man , and wh o had glimpsed in his view of life an d huma n personality something tha t could be helpful to them. An d Jun g was very pleased, not simply at getting letters (his mail was enormous at all times) but at getting them from people who would normally have no contac t with him. It was at this momen t tha t he dreame d a dream of the greatest importanc e to him. (And as you read this book, you will understand just how importan t tha t can be.) He dreame d that, instead of sitting in his study an d talking to the grea t doctors an d psychiatrists who used to call on him from all over the world, he was standing in a public place an d addressing a multitud e of peopl e who were listening to him with rapt attention an d understanding what he said. . . . When , a week or two later, Foges renewed his request tha t Jun g should undertak e a new book designed, not for the clinic or the philosopher's study, bu t for the people in the marke t place, Jun g allowed himself to be persuaded. H e laid down two conditions. First, tha t the book should not be a single-handed book, but the collective effort of himself an d a grou p of his closest followers, through whom he had attempte d to perpetuat e his methods an d his teaching. Secondly, tha t I should be entrusted with the task of co-ordinating the work an d resolving any problems tha t might arise between the authors and the publishers. Lest it should seem tha t this introduction transgresses the bounds of reasonable modesty, let me say at once tha t I was gratified by this second condition — but within measure . For it very soon came to my knowledge tha t Jung's reason for selecting me was essentially tha t he I () regarded me as being of reasonable , bu t not exceptional, intelligence and without the slightest serious knowledge of psychology. Thu s I was to Jun g the "averag e reader " of this book ; wha t I could understan d would be intelligible to all wh o would be interested; wha t I boggled at might possibly be too difficult or obscur e for some. Not undul y flattered by this estimate of my role, I have none the less scrupulously insisted (sometimes, I fear, to the exasperation of the authors) on having every paragrap h written and , if necessary, rewritten to a degree of clarity an d directness tha t enables me to say with confidence tha t this book in its entirety is designed for an d addressed to the general reader, and tha t the complex subjects it deals with are treated with a rar e and encouraging simplicity. After muc h discussion, the comprehensive subject of this book was agreed to be Ma n an d his Symbols; an d Jun g himself selected as his collaborators in the work Dr. Marie-Louis e von Fran z of Zurich, perhaps his closest professional confidante an d friend; Dr. Josep h L. Hen - derson of San Francisco, one of the most prominen t an d trusted of American Jungians; Mrs. Aniela Jaffe of Zurich, who, in addition to being an experienced analyst, was Jung's confidential privat e secretary and his biographer; an d Dr. Joland e Jacobi , wh o after Jun g himself is the most experienced autho r amon g Jung's Zurich circle. Thes e four people were chosen partly because of their skill an d experience in the particular subjects allocated to them an d partly because all of them were completely trusted by Jun g to work unselfishly to his instructions as members of a team. Jung's personal responsibility was to plan the structure of the whole book, to supervise an d direct the work of his collaborators, an d himself to write the keynot e chapter, "Approachin g the Unconscious. " T h e last yea r of his life was devoted almost entirely to this book, and when he died in Jun e 1961, his own section was complet e (he finished it, in fact, only some 10 days before his final illness) an d his colleagues' chapters had all been approve d by him in draft. After his death , Dr. von Franz assumed over-all responsibility for the completion of the book in accordanc e with Jung's express instructions. Th e subject matte r of Man and his Symbols an d its outline were therefore laid down— and in detail—by Jung . Th e chapte r tha t bears his name is his work and (apart from some fairly extensive editing to improve its intelligi1 1 bility to the genera l reader) nobod y else's. It was written, incidentally, in English. Th e remainin g chapters were written by the various authors to Jung's direction an d unde r his supervision. Th e final editing of the complet e work after Jung's deat h has been done by Dr. von Fran z with a patience , understanding , an d good humo r tha t leave the publishers and myself greatly in her debt. Finally as to the contents of the book itself: Jung's thinking has colored the world of moder n psychology mor e than man y of those with casual knowledge realize. Such familiar terms, for instance, as "extravert, " "introvert, " an d "archetype " are all Jungia n concepts—borrowed an d sometimes misused by others. But his overwhelming contribution to psychological understandin g is his concept of the unconscious—not (like the unconscious of Freud) merely a sort of glory-hole of repressed desires, but a world tha t is just as muc h a vital an d real part of the life of an individua l as the conscious, "cogitating " world of the ego, an d infinitely wider an d richer. Th e language an d the "people " of the unconscious are symbols, and the means of communication s dreams. Thu s an examinatio n of Ma n an d his Symbols is in effect an examination of man's relation to his own unconscious. An d since in Jung's view the unconscious is the grea t guide , friend, an d adviser of the conscious, this book is related in the most direct terms to the study of huma n beings an d their spiritual problems. W e know the unconscious and communicat e with it (a two-way service) principally by dreams; and all throug h this book (above all in Jung's own chapter) you will find a quit e remarkabl e emphasis placed on the importanc e of dreaming in the life of the individual. It would be a n impertinenc e on my part to attemp t to interpre t Jung's work to readers, man y of whom will surely be far better qualified to understan d it tha n I am. M y role, remember, was merely to serve as a sort of "intelligibility filter" an d by no means as a n interpreter. Nevertheless, I ventur e to offer two general points tha t seem importan t to me as a layma n and tha t ma y possibly be helpful to othe r non-experts. Th e first is abou t dreams. To Jungian s the dream is not a kind of standardized cryptogram tha t can be decoded by a glossary of symbol meanings. It is a n integral, important, an d personal expression of the individual unconscious. It is just as "real " as an y othe r I 2 phenomeno n attachin g to the individual. The, dreamer's individual unconscious is communicatin g with the dreame r alone an d is selecting symbols for its purpos e tha t have meanin g to the dreame r an d to nobody else. Thu s the interpretation of dreams, whethe r by the analyst or by the dreame r himself, is for the Jungia n psychologist an entirely personal an d individua l business (and sometimes a n experimenta l and very lengthy one as well) tha t can by no means be undertake n by rule of thumb . T h e converse of this is tha t the communication s of the unconscious are of the highest importanc e to the dreamer—naturall y so, since the unconscious is at least half of his total being—an d frequently offer him advice or guidanc e tha t could be obtaine d from no othe r source. Thus, when I described Jung's dream abou t addressing the multitude , I was not describing a piece of magi c or suggesting tha t Jun g dabbled in fortune telling. I was recounting in the simple terms of daily experience how Jun g was "advised " by his own unconscious to reconsider an inadequat e judgmen t he had mad e with the conscious part of his mind. Now it follows from this tha t the dreamin g of dreams is not a matte r that the well-adjusted Jungia n can regard as simply a matte r of chance. O n the contrary, the ability to establish communication s with the unconscious is a part of the whole man , an d Jungian s "teach " themselves (I can think of no bette r term) to be receptive to dreams. When, therefore, Jun g himself 1 was faced with the critical decision whether or not to write this book, he was able to draw on the resources of both his conscious and his unconscious in makin g u p his mind. An d all through this book you will find the dream treated as a direct, personal, and meaningful communicatio n to the dreame r —a communica - tion that uses the symbols commo n to ajl mankind , but tha t uses them on every occasion in an entirely individua l way tha t can be interpreted only by an entirely individua l "key. " T h e second point I wish to mak e is abou t a particula r characteristic of argumentative metho d tha t is commo n to all the writers of this book perhaps to all Jungians. Thos e wh o have limited themselves to living entirely in the world of the conscious and who reject communicatio n with the unconscious bind themselves by the laws of conscious, formal life. With the infallible (but often meaningless) logic of the algebraic equation, they argue from assumed premises to incontestably deduced '3 conclusions. Jun g an d his colleagues seem to me (whethe r they know it or not) to reject the limitations of this metho d of argument. It is not tha t they ignore logic, bu t they appea r all the time to be arguing to the unconscious as well as to the conscious. Their dialectical metho d is itself symbolic an d often devious. The y convince not by means of the narrowly focused spotlight of the syllogism, but by skirting, by repetition, by presenting a recurring view of the same subject seen each time from a slightly different angl e — until suddenly the reade r wh o has never been awar e of a single, conclusive momen t of proof finds tha t he has unknowingly embrace d and taken into himself some wider truth. Jung's arguments (and those of his colleagues) spiral upwar d over his subject like a bird circling a tree. At first, nea r the ground , it sees only a confusion of leaves an d branches. Gradually , as it circles higher a n d higher, the recurring aspects of the tree form a wholeness and relate to their surroundings. Some readers ma y find this "spiraling " metho d of argumen t obscur e or even confusing for a few pages—but not, I think, for long. It is characteristic of Jung's method , and very soon the reade r will find it carrying him with it on a persuasive and profoundly absorbing journey . T h e different sections of this book speak for themselves an d require little introduction from me. Jung's own chapte r introduce s the reade r to the unconscious, to the archetype s an d symbols tha t form its language an d to the dreams by which it communicates. Dr. Henderso n in the following chapte r illustrates the appearanc e of several archetypa l patterns in ancient mythology, folk legend, and primitive ritual. Dr. von Franz , in the chapte r entitled "Th e Process of Individuation, " describes the process by which the conscious an d the unconscious within an individua l learn to know, respect, and accommodat e one another. In a certain sense this chapte r contains not only the crux of the whole book, bu t perhap s the essence of Jung's philosophy of life: M a n becomes whole, integrated, calm, fertile, an d happ y when (and only when) the process of individuation is complete , when the conscious an d the unconscious have learned to live at peace an d to complement one another. Mrs. Jaffe, like Dr. Henderson , is concerned with demonstrating, in the familiar fabric of the conscious, man's recurring interest in—almost obsession with — the symbols of the unconscious. The y have for him a profoundly significant, almost a nour14 ishing an d sustaining, inne r attraction — whethe r they occur in the myths an d fairy tales tha t Dr. Henderso n analyzes or in the visual arts, which, as Mrs. Jaffe shows, satisfy an d delight us by a constant appea l to the unconscious. Finally, I must say a brief word abou t Dr. Jacobi's chapter, which is somewha t separat e from the rest of the book. It is in fact an abbre - viated case history of one interesting an d successful analysis. Th e value of such a chapte r in a book like this is obvious; but two words of warning are nevertheless necessary. First, as Dr. von Fran z points out, there is no such thing as a typical Jungia n analysis. Ther e can't be, because every dream is a privat e an d individua l communication , and no two dreams use the symbols of the unconscious in the same way. So every Jungia n analysis is uniqu e — an d it is misleading to consider this one, taken from Dr. Jacobi's clinical files (or an y othe r one there has ever been), as "representative " or "typical. " All one can say of the case of Henry an d his sometimes lurid dreams is tha t they form one true example of the way in which the Jungia n metho d ma y be applied to a particula r case. Secondly, the full history of even a comparatively uncomplicated case would take a whole book to recount. Inevitably, the story of Henry's analysis suffers a little in compression. Th e references, for instance, to the / Ching have been somewha t obscured an d lent an unnatura l (and to me unsatisfactory) flavor of the occult by being presented out of their full context. Nevertheless, we concluded—an d I am sure the reade r will agre e — that, with the warnings duly given, the clarity, to say nothing of the huma n interest, of Henry's analysis greatly enriches this book. I began by describing how Jun g came to write Man and his Symbols. I end by remindin g the reade r of wha t a remarkabl e — perhaps uniqu e —publication this is. Carl Gusta v Jun g was one of the grea t doctors of all time an d one of the grea t thinkers of this century. His object always was to help me n an d wome n to know themselves, so tha t by self-knowledge an d thoughtful self-use they could lead full, rich, an d happ y lives. At the very end of his own life, which was as full, rich, an d happ y as any I have encountered, he decided to use the strength tha t was left him to address his message to a wide r public than he had ever tried to reach before. H e completed his task an d his life in the same month. This book is his legacy to the broa d reading public. ' 5 Contents Part 1 Approaching the unconscious 18 Carl G.

Jung The entrance to the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Rameses III Approaching the unconscious The importance of dreams M a n uses the spoken or written word to express the meanin g of wha t he wants to convey. His language is full of symbols, but he also often employs signs or images tha t are not strictly descriptive. Some arc mere abbreviations or strings of initials, such as UN, UNICEF , or UNESCO ; others are familiar trade marks, the name s of patent medicines, badges, or insignia. Although these are meaningless in themselves, they have acquired a recognizable meaning through commo n usage or deliberate intent. Such things are not symbols. The y are signs, and they do no mor e than denot e the objects to which they are attached. Wha t we call a symbol is a term, a name , or even a picture tha t ma y be familiar in daily life, yet tha t possesses specific connotations in addition to its conventiona l an d obvious meaning. It implies something vague , unknown , or hidden from us. Man y Creta n monuments, for instance, arc marke d with the design of the doubl e adze . This is an object tha t we know, b ut we do not know its symbolic implications. For anothe r example , take the case of the India n who, after a visit to England, told his friends at home tha t the English worship animals, because he had found eagles, lions, and oxen in old churches. He was not awar e (nor are man y Christians) tha t these animals are symbols of the Evangelists and are derived from the vision of Ezekiel, and that this in turn has an analogy to the Egyptian sun god Horus and his four sons. Ther e are, moreover, such objects as the wheel and the cross tha t are known all over the world, yet that have a symbolic significance unde r certain conditions. Precisely wha t they symbolize is still a matte r for controversial speculation. Thu s a word or an image is symbolic whe n it implies something mor e than its obvious and immediat e meaning. It has a wide r "uncon - scious " aspect tha t is never precisely defined or fully explained. Nor can one hope to define or explain it. As the mind explores the symbol, it is led to ideas tha t lie beyond the grasp of reason. Th e wheel may lead our thoughts toward the concept of a "divine " sun, but at this point reason must admit its incompetence ; ma n is unable to define a "divine " being. When , with all our intellectual limitations, we call something "divine, " we have merely given it a name, which may be based on a creed, but never on factual evidence. Because there are innumerabl e things beyond the range of huma n understanding , we constantly use symbolic terms to represent concepts that we cannot define or fully comprehend . This is one reason why all religions employ symbolic language or images. But this conscious use of symbols is only one aspect of a psychological fact of great importance : Ma n also produce s symbols unconsciously and spontaneously, in the form of dreams. Left, three of the four Evangelists (in a relief on Chartres Cathedral) appear as animals: The lion is Mark, the ox Luke, the eagle John. Also animals are three of the sons of the Egyptian god Horus (above, c. 1 250 B.C.), Animals, and groups of four, are universal religious symbols. It is not easy to grasp this point. But the point must be grasped if we are to know more abou t the ways in which the huma n mind works. Man , as we realize if we reflect for a moment, never perceives anything fully or comprehends anythin g completely. He can see, hear, touch, an d taste; but how far he sees, how well he hears, wha t his touch tells him, and wha t he tastes depend upon the numbe r and quality of his senses. Thes e limit his perception of the world aroun d him. By using scientific instruments he can partly compensat e for the deficiencies of his senses. For example , he can extend the range of his vision by binoculars or of his hearing by electrical amplification. But the most elaborat e apparatu s cannot do mor e than bring distant or small objects within range of his eyes, or mak e faint sounds mor e audible . No matte r wha t instruments he uses, at some point he reaches the edge of certainty beyond which conscious knowledge cannot pass. 24 In many societies, representations of the sun express man's indefinable religious experience. Above, a decoration on the back of a throne belonging to the 14th-century B.C. Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen is dominated by a sun disk; the hands at the end of the rays symbolize the sun's life-giving power. Left, a monk in 20th-century Japan prays before a mirror that represents the divine Sun in the Shinto religion. Right, tungsten atoms seen with a microscope that magnifies 2,000,000 times. Far right, the spots in center of picture are the farthest visible galaxies. No matter how far man extends his senses, limits to his conscious perception remain. Ther e are , moreover , unconsciou s aspects of our perceptio n of reality . Th e first is th e fact that even whe n ou r sense s reac t to rea l pheno - mena , sights, an d sounds, the y ar e someho w translated from th e real m of realit y int o tha t of the mind . Withi n th e min d the y becom e psychic events, whos e ultimat e natur e is un - knowabl e (for th e psych e canno t kno w its ow n psychical substance) . Thu s ever y experienc e contains a n indefinit e numbe r of unknow n fac - tors, not to spea k of th e fact tha t ever y concret e object is alway s unknow n in certai n respects, because w e canno t kno w th e ultimat e natur e of matte r itself. The n ther e ar e certai n events of whic h w e have not consciousl y take n note ; the y hav e re - mained, so to speak , belo w th e threshol d o f con - sciousness. The y hav e happened , bu t the y hav e been absorbe d subliminally , withou t ou r con - scious knowledge . W e ca n becom e awar e of such happening s onl y in a momen t of intuitio n or by a process of profoun d though t tha t lead s to a late r realizatio n tha t the y must hav e hap - pened ; an d thoug h w e ma y hav e originall y ignored their emotiona l an d vita l importance , it later wells u p from th e unconsciou s a s a sort of afterthought . It ma y appear , for instance , in th e form o f a dream. As a genera l rule , th e unconsciou s aspect of an y even t is reveale d to us in dreams , wher e it appears no t a s a rationa l though t bu t as a symboli c image . As a matte r of history , it w a s th e stud y o f dream s tha t first enable d psychologists t o investigat e th e unconsciou s aspec t of consciou s psychi c events. It is o n suc h evidenc e tha t psychologists assum e th e existenc e of a n unconsciou s psych e — thoug h man y scientists an d philosophers den y its existence . The y argu e naivel y tha t suc h a n assumptio n implie s th e existenc e of tw o "sub - jects, " o r (to pu t it in a commo n phrase ) tw o personalitie s withi n th e sam e individual . But this is exactl y wha t it doe s imply—quit e correctly . An d it is on e of th e curse s of moder n m a n tha t man y peopl e suffer from this divide d personality . It is b y n o mean s a pathologica l symptom ; it is a norma l fact tha t ca n b e ob - serve d a t an y tim e an d everywhere . It is no t merel y th e neuroti c whos e righ t han d doe s no t kno w wha t th e left han d is doing . This predica - men t is a sympto m o f a genera l unconsciousness tha t is th e undeniabl e commo n inheritanc e of all mankind .

An d this evolutio n is far from com - plete , for larg e area s o f th e huma n min d ar e still shroude d in darkness. Wha t w e call th e "psyche " is b y n o mean s identica l wit h ou r consciousness an d its contents.

" Thos e wh o sa y suc h thing s merel y express a n age-ol d "misoneism " — a fea r of th e ne w an d th e unknown . 2 3 Ther e ar e historica l reason s for this resistanc e to th e ide a of a n unknow n par t of th e huma n psyche . Consciousness is a ver y recen t acquisitio n o f nature , an d it is still in a n "experimen - tal " state . It is frail, menace d b y specifi c dan - gers, an d easil y injured . As anthropologists hav e noted , on e of th e most commo n menta l de - rangement s tha t occu r amon g primitiv e peopl e is wha t the y call "th e loss o f a soul " —whic h means, a s th e nam e indicates, a noticeabl e disruptio n (or, mor e technically , a dissociation ) of consciousness. Amon g suc h people , whos e consciousness is a t a differen t leve l of developmen t from ours, t h e "soul " (or psyche ) is no t felt to b e a unit . Man y primitive s assum e tha t a ma n ha s a "bus h soul " as well as his own , an d tha t this bus h soul is incarnat e in a wil d anima l o r a tree , wit h whic h th e huma n individua l ha s som e kin d of psychi c identity . This is wha t th e distin - guishe d Frenc h ethnologist Lucie n Levy-Briih l calle d a "mystica l participation. " H e late r re - tracte d this ter m unde r pressur e of advers e criticism, bu t I believ e tha t his critic s wer e wrong . It is a well-know n psychologica l fact tha t a n individua l ma y hav e suc h a n uncon - sciou s identit y wit h som e othe r perso n o r object. This identit y take s a variet y of forms amon g primitives. If th e bus h soul is tha t of a n animal , t h e anima l itself is considere d a s som e sort of brothe r to th e man . A ma n whos e brothe r is a crocodile , for instance , is suppose d to b e safe whe n swimmin g a crocodile-infeste d river. If t h e bus h sou l is a tree , th e tre e is presume d to hav e somethin g like parenta l authorit y ove r th e individua l concerned . I n bot h case s a n injur y t o th e bus h sou l is interprete d a s a n injur y to t h e man . I n som e tribes, it is assume d tha t a ma n ha s a numbe r of souls; this belie f expresse s th e feeli n g o f som e primitiv e individuals tha t the y eac h consist of severa l linke d bu t distinc t units.

W e to o ca n becom e dissociate d an d lose "Dissociation " means a splitting in the psyche, causing a neurosis. A famou s fictional example of thi s state is Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886 ) by the Scots author R. L Stevenson. In the story Jekyll' s "split" took the for m of a physical change, rather than (as in reality) an inner, psychic state. Left, Mr. Hyde (from the 1 93 2 film of the story) —Jekyll' s "othe r half." Primitive people call dissociation "los s of a soul"; they believe that a ma n has a "bus h soul" as wel l as his own . Right, a Nyang a tribesman of wes t central Africa wearin g a mask of the hornbil l — the bird that he identifies wit h his bush soul. Far right, telephonist s on a bus y switchboar d handle man y calls at once. In such jobs people "split off" parts of their conscious mind s to concentrate. But this split is controlled and temporary, not a spontaneous , abnormal dissociation. 2 I our identity .

Beyond doubt , eve n in wha t w e call a hig h level of civilization , huma n consciousness ha s not yet achieve d a reasonabl e degre e of continuity. It is still vulnerabl e an d liabl e to fragmentation . This capacit y to isolat e par t of one's mind, indeed , is a valuabl e characteristic . It enables us to concentrat e upo n on e thin g a t a time, excludin g everythin g else tha t ma y clai m our attention . But ther e is a worl d of differenc e between a consciou s decisio n to split off an d temporaril y suppress a par t of one's psyche , an d a conditio n in whic h this happen s spontane - ously, withou t one's knowledg e o r consen t an d even against one's intention . Th e forme r is a civilized achievement , th e latte r a primitiv e "loss of a soul, " o r eve n th e pathologica l caus e of a neurosis.

T o explai n m y poin t of view , I shoul d like to describ e ho w it develope d ove r a perio d of years, an d ho w I wa s led to conclud e tha t dream s ar e th e most frequen t an d universall y accessibl e sourc e for th e investigatio n of man's symbolizin g faculty . Sigmun d Freu d wa s th e pionee r wh o first trie d to explor e empiricall y th e unconsciou s backgroun d of consciousness. H e worke d o n th e genera l assumptio n tha t dream s ar e no t a matte r of chanc e bu t ar e associate d wit h consciou s thoughts an d problems. This assumptio n wa s n o t in th e least arbitrary . It wa s base d upo n th e 2 5 conclusio n of eminen t neurologists (for instance , Pierr e Janet ) tha t neuroti c symptom s ar e re - late d to som e consciou s experience . The y eve n appea r to b e split-off area s of th e consciou s mind , which , a t anothe r tim e an d unde r differe n t conditions, ca n b e conscious. Befor e th e beginnin g of this century , Freu d a n d Jose f Breue r ha d recognize d tha t neuroti c symptom s — hysteria , certai n type s of pain , an d abnorma l behavior—ar e in fact symbolicall y meaningful . The y ar e on e wa y in whic h th e unconsciou s min d expresse s itself, just a s it m a y in dreams ; an d the y ar e equall y symbolic . A patient , for instance , wh o is confronte d wit h a n intolerabl e situatio n ma y develo p a spas m wheneve r h e trie s to swallow : H e "can' t swall ow it.

I coul d cit e man y example s of this kind , bu t suc h physica l reaction s ar e onl y on e form in whic h th e problem s tha t troubl e us unconsci - ousl y ma y express themselves.

Freu d attache d particula r importanc e to dreams as th e poin t of departur e for a process of "fre e association. " Bu t afte r a tim e I bega n to feel tha t this wa s a misleadin g an d inadequat e us e of th e ric h fantasie s tha t th e unconsciou s produce s in sleep .

Thi s episod e opene d m v eve s to the far! tha i it wa s no t necessar y to us e a drea m as th e poin t of departur e for th e process of "fre e association " if on e wishe d to discove r th e complexe s of a patient . It showe d m e tha t on e ca n reac h th e cente r directl y from an y poin t of th e compass. O n e coul d begi n from Cyrilli c letters, from Left, many of the great pioneers of modern psychoanalysis, photo - graphed at a Congress of Psychoanalysis in i 911 at Weimar, Germany. The key, belo w left, identifies some of the major figures. Right, the "inkblot" test devised by the Swiss psychiatrist Herman n Rorschach. The shape of the blot can serve as a stimulus for free association; in fact, almost any irregular free shape can spark off the associative process. Leonardo da Vinci wrot e in his Notebooks: "It should not be hard for you t o stop sometimes and look into the stains of walls , or ashes of a fire, or clouds, or mu d or like places, in which .. . you may find really marvelous ideas." meditation s upo n a crysta l ball , a praye r wheel , o r a moder n painting , o r eve n from casua l con - versatio n abou t som e quit e trivia l event . Th e drea m wa s n o mor e an d n o less useful in this respec t tha n an y othe r possibl e startin g point . Nevertheless, dream s hav e a particula r significance , eve n thoug h the y often aris e from a n emotiona l upse t in whic h th e habitua l complexe s a r e als o involved . (Th e habitua l complexe s ar e t h e tende r spots of th e psyche , whic h reac t most quickl y to a n externa l stimulu s o r disturbance. ) Tha t is wh y free associatio n ca n lea d on e from a n y drea m to th e critica l secre t thoughts. At this point , however , it occurre d to m e tha t (if I wa s righ t so far) it migh t reasonabl y follow tha t dream s hav e som e specia l an d mor e significant functio n of their own . Ver y ofte n dream s hav e a definite , evidentl y purposefu l structure , indicatin g a n underlyin g ide a o r intentio n though , a s a rule , th e latte r is no t immediatel y comprehensible . I therefor e bega n to conside r whethe r on e shoul d pa y mor e attentio n to th e actua l form an d conten t of a dream , rathe r tha n allowin g ""free " associatio n to lea d on e off throug h a trai n of idea s to complexe s tha t coul d as easily b e reache d b y othe r means. This ne w though t wa s a turnin g poin t in th e developmen t of m y psychology . It mean t tha t I graduall y gav e u p followin g association s tha t led far awa y from th e tex t of a dream . I chos e to concentrat e rathe r o n th e association s to th e drea m itself, believin g tha t th e latte r expresse d somethin g specifi c tha t th e unconsciou s wa s tryin g to say . T h e chang e in m y attitud e towar d dream s involve d a chang e of method ; th e ne w tech - T w o different possible stimul i of free association: the whirlin g prayer whee l of a Tibetan beggar (left), or a fortune teller's crystal ball (right, a moder n crystal gazer at a British fair). niqu e wa s on e tha t coul d tak e accoun t of all t h e variou s wide r aspects of a dream . A stor y tol d b y th e consciou s min d ha s a beginning , a development , an d a n end , bu t th e sam e is no t tru e of a dream . Its dimension s in tim e an d spac e ar e quit e different ; to understan d it yo u must examin e it from ever y aspect—just as yo u m a y tak e a n unknow n objec t in you r hand s an d tur n it ove r an d ove r unti l yo u ar e familia r wit h ever y detai l of its shape . Perhap s I hav e no w sai d enoug h to sho w ho w I cam e increasingl y to disagre e wit h "free " associatio n as Freu d first employe d it: I wante d to kee p a s clos e a s possibl e to th e drea m itself, a n d to exclud e all th e irrelevan t idea s an d association s tha t it migh t evoke . True , thes e coul d lea d on e towar d th e complexe s of a patient , b u t I ha d a mor e far-reachin g purpos e in min d tha n th e discover y of complexe s tha t caus e neuroti c disturbances. Ther e ar e man y othe r mean s b y whic h thes e ca n b e identified : Th e psychologist , for instance , ca n ge t all th e hints h e need s b y usin g word-associatio n tests (b y aski n g th e patien t wha t h e associate s to a give n set of words, an d b y studyin g his responses). But to kno w an d understan d th e psychi c life- process of a n individual's whol e personality , it is importan t to realiz e tha t his dream s an d their symboli c image s hav e a muc h mor e importan t role to play . Almost everyon e knows, for example , tha t there is a n enormou s variet y of image s b y whic h the sexua l ac t ca n b e symbolize d (or, on e migh t say, represente d in th e form of a n allegory). Each of thes e image s ca n lead , b y a process of association, to th e ide a of sexua l intercours e an d to specific complexe s tha t an y individua l ma y have abou t his ow n sexua l attitudes. Bu t on e could just a s well uneart h suc h complexe s b y day-dreamin g o n a set of indecipherabl e Russia n letters. I wa s thu s led to th e assumptio n tha t a dream ca n contai n som e messag e othe r tha n th e sexual allegory , an d tha t it doe s so for definit e reasons. T o illustrat e this point : A ma n ma y drea m of insertin g a key in a lock, of wieldin g a heav y stick, o r of breakin g down a doo r wit h a batterin g ram . Eac h of these ca n be regarde d as a sexua l allegory . But the fact tha t his unconsciou s for its ow n pur - poses ha s chose n on e of thes e specific image s it ma y be th e key, th e stick, o r th e batterin g ram is also of majo r significance . Th e rea l task is to understan d why th e key ha s bee n preferred to th e stick, o r th e stick to th e ram . And sometime s this migh t eve n lea d on e to discover tha t it is not th e sexua l ac t a t all tha t is represented, bu t som e quit e differen t psycholo - gical point. From this lin e of reasoning , I conclude d tha t only the materia l tha t is clearl y an d visibly part of a drea m shoul d b e use d in interpretin g it. T h e drea m ha s its ow n limitation . Its specifi c One of the countless symboli c or allegorical images of the sexual act isa deer hunt: Right, a detai l from a painting by the 16th-centur y German artist Cranach. The sexual implication of the deer hunt is underlined by a medieval English folk song called "Th e Keeper": The first doe that he shot at he missed. And the second doe he trimmed he kissed, And the third ran away in a young man's heart. She's amongst the leaves of the green 0 form itself tells us wha t belong s to it an d wha t lead s awa y from it. Whil e "free " associatio n lure s on e awa y from tha t materia l in a kin d of zigza g line , th e metho d I evolve d is mor e like a circumambulatio n whos e cente r is th e drea m picture . I wor k all aroun d th e drea m pictur e a n d disregar d ever y attemp t tha t th e dreame r make s to brea k awa y from it. Tim e an d time again , in m y professiona l work , I hav e ha d to repea t th e words: "Let's ge t bac k to you r dream . Wha t doe s th e dream say? " F o r instance , a patien t of min e dreame d of a drunke n an d dishevele d vulga r woman . I n t h e dream , it seeme d tha t this woma n wa s his wife, thoug h in rea l life his wife wa s totall y different. O n th e surface , therefore , th e drea m w a s shockingl y untrue , an d th e patien t imme - diatel y rejecte d it as drea m nonsense . If I, as his doctor , ha d let hi m start a process of associa - tion , h e woul d inevitabl y hav e trie d to ge t as far awa y a s possibl e from (he unpleasan t suggestio n of his dream . I n tha t case , h e woul d hav e ende d wit h on e of his stapl e complexe s a complex , possibly , tha t ha d nothin g to d o wit h his wife a n d w e shoul d hav e learne d nothin g abou t th e specia l meanin g of this particula r dream . A key in a lock may be a sexual symbo l — but not invariably. Left, a section of an altarpiece by the 1 5th-centur y Flemish artist Campin . The door wa s intended to symbolize hope, the lock to symbolize charity, and the key to symbolize the desire for God . Below, a British bisho p durin g the consecration of a churc h carries out a traditional ceremon y by knockin g on the churc h doo r wit h a staff—whic h is obviousl y not a phallic symbo l but a symbo l of authorit y and the shepherd' s crook. No individual symboli c image can be said to have a dogmaticall y fixed, generalized meaning . The "anima " is the female element in the male unconscious . (It and the "animus " in the female unconsciou s are discussed in Chapter 3.) Thi s inner duality is often symbolized by a hermaphroditi c figure, like the crowne d hermaphrodite, above right, from a 1 7th-centur y alchemical manuscript. Right, a physical image of man' s psychic "bisexuality": a huma n cell wit h its chromosomes . Al l organisms have tw o sets of chromosomes—on e from each parent. ,30 What , then , wa s his unconsciou s tryin g to convey by suc h a n obviousl y untru e statement ? Clearly, it someho w expresse d th e ide a of a degenerat e femal e wh o wa s closely connecte d with the dreamer's life; bu t sinc e th e projectio n of this imag e o n to his wife wa s unjustifie d an d factually untrue , I ha d to look elsewher e before I foun d ou t wha t this repulsiv e imag e represented . In the Middl e Ages, lon g befor e th e physio - logists demonstrate d tha t b y reaso n of ou r glandula r structur e ther e ar e bot h mal e an d femal e elements in all of us, it wa s said tha t "ever y ma n carrie s a woma n withi n himsel f It is this femal e elemen t in ever y mal e tha t I hav e calle d th e "anima. " This "feminine " aspec t is essentiall y a certai n inferio r kin d of relatedness to th e surroundings, an d particu - larl y to women , whic h is kep t carefull y con - ceale d from others as well as from oneself. I n othe r words, thoug h a n individual's visiblepersonalit y ma y seem quit e normal , h e ma y well be concealin g from others or eve n fro m himself—th e deplorabl e conditio n of "th e woma n within. " Tha t wa s th e cas e wit h this particula r patient : His femal e sid e wa s no t nice . His drea m wa s actuall y sayin g to him : "Yo u ar e in som e respects behavin g like a degenerat e female, " an d thu s gav e hi m a n appropriat e shock . (A n exampl e of this kind , of course , must n o t b e take n as evidenc e tha t th e unconsciou s is concerne d wit h "moral " injunctions. Th e drea m wa s no t tellin g th e patien t to "behav e better, " bu t wa s simpl y tryin g to balanc e th e lopside d natur e of his consciou s mind , whic h w a s maintainin g th e fiction tha t h e wa s a perfec t gentlema n throughout. ) It is eas y to understan d wh y dreamer s ten d to ignor e an d eve n den y th e messag e of their dreams. Consciousness naturall y resists any - thin g unconsciou s an d unknown . I hav e alread y pointe d ou t th e existenc e amon g primitiv e people s of wha t anthropologists call "miso - ncism, " a dee p an d superstitiou s fear of novelty .

Th e tw o fundamenta l points in deal - i n g wit h dream s ar e these : First, th e drea m shoul d b e treate d a s a fact, abou t whic h on e must mak e n o previou s assumptio n excep t tha t it someho w make s sense ; an d second , th e drea m is a specifi c expressio n of th e unconscious. O n e coul d scarcel y pu t thes e principle s mor e modestly . N o matte r ho w low anyone's opinio n of th e unconsciou s ma y be , h e must conced e tha t it is wort h investigating ; th e unconsciou s is a t least o n a level wit h th e louse , which , afte r all, enjoy s th e honest interest of th e entomolo - gist. If somebod y wit h littl e experienc e an d knowledg e of dream s think s tha t dream s arcjust chaoti c occurrence s withou t meaning , h e is a t libert y to d o so. But if on e assume s tha t the y ar e norma l events (which , as a matte r of fact, the y are) , on e is boun d to conside r tha t the y ar c eithe r causa l i.e. tha t ther e is a rationa l caus e for their existenc e o r in a certai n wa y purposive , o r both . L e t us no w look a littl e mor e closely at th e way s in whic h th e consciou s an d unconsciou s contents of th e min d ar e linke d together. Tak e a n exampl e wit h whic h everyon e is familiar. Suddenl y yo u find yo u canno t remembe r wha t y o u wer e goin g to sa y next , thoug h a momen t a g o th e though t wa s perfectl y clear.

It is simpl y ou t of sight. Just a s w e ma y late r see th e ca r again , so we com e across thoughts tha t wer e tem - poraril y lost to us. Thus, par t of th e unconsciou s consists of a multitud e of temporaril y obscure d thoughts, impressions, an d image s that , in spit e of bein g lost, continu e to influenc e ou r consciou s minds. A ma n wh o is distracte d o r "absent-minded" " will wal k across th e roo m to fetch something . He stops, seemingl y perplexed ; h e ha s forgotte n what he wa s after. His hand s grop e abou t amon g th e objects o n th e tabl e as if h e wer e sleepwalking ; h e is obliviou s of his origina l purpose , yet h e is unconsciousl y guide d by it. Then he realize s wha t it is tha t h e wants. His unconscious ha s prompte d him . If you observ e th e behavio r of a neuroti c person, yo u ca n see hi m doin g man y thing s that he appears to b e doin g consciousl y an d purposefully. Ye t if yo u ask hi m abou t them , you will discove r tha t h e is eithe r unconsciou s of them or ha s somethin g quit e differen t in mind. H e hears an d doe s no t hear ; h e sees, yet is blind ; h e know s an d is ignorant . Suc h examples ar e so commo n tha t th e specialist soo n realizes tha t unconsciou s contents of th e min d behave as if the y wer e consciou s an d tha t yo u can neve r b e sure , in suc h cases, whethe r thought, speech , o r actio n is consciou s o r not .

Wha t I hav e so far sai d abou t th e uncon - sciou s is n o mor e tha n a cursor y sketc h of th e natur e an d functionin g of this comple x par t of t h e huma n psyche . Bu t it shoul d hav e indicate d t h e kin d of sublimina l materia l from whic h th e symbols o f ou r dream s ma y b e spontaneousl y produced . This sublimina l materia l ca n consist of all urges, impulses, an d intentions: all perception s an d intuitions; all rationa l o r irrationa l thoughts, conclusions, inductions, deductions, a n d premises; an d all varietie s of feeling. An y o r all of thes e ca # n tak e th e form of partial , temporary , o r constan t unconsciousness. Suc h materia l ha s mostl y becom e uncon - sciou s becaus e — in a manne r of speakin g — ther e is n o roo m for it in th e consciou s mind . Som e of one's thoughts lose their emotiona l energ y an d becom e sublimina l (tha t is t o say , the y n o longe r receiv e so muc h of ou r consciou s attention ) becaus e the y hav e com e to seem un - interestin g o r irrelevant , o r becaus e ther e is som e reaso n wh y w e wis h t o pus h the m ou t of sight. It is, in fact, norma l an d necessar y for us to "forget " in this fashion , in orde r to mak e roo m in ou r consciou s mind s for ne w impression s an d ideas.

B u t just as consciou s contents ca n vanis h int o th e unconscious, ne w contents, whic h hav e neve r ye t bee n conscious, ca n arise from it.

A grea t dea l ol contro - versia l discussio n ha s arise n aroun d this point .

The y express new thoughts lin t hav e neve r vet reache d th e threshol d ol consciousness. The 19th centur y German chemis t Kekule, researching into the molecular structure of benzene, dreamed of a snake wit h its tail in its mout h (This is an age-ol d symbol : left, a representation of it from a third-centur y B.C. Greek manuscript.) He interpreted the dream to mean that the structure w a s a closed carbon ring as on the page, far left, from his Textbook of Organic Chemistry (1861 ) Right, an ordinary European highwa y wit h a familiar sign that means "look out for animals crossing." But the motorist s (their shadow s appear In the foregroun d as they leave their car) see an elephant, a rhinoceros , even a dinosaur. Thi s painting of a dream (by the moder n Swis s artist Erhard Jacoby ) accurately depict s the apparentl y illogical, incoherent nature of dream imagery. |8 The function of dreams I hav e gon e int o som e detai l abou t th e origin s of ou r drea m life, becaus e it is th e soil from which most symbols originall y grow . Unfortunately , dream s ar e difficult to understand . As I hav e alread y pointe d out , a drea m is quit e unlike a stor y told by th e consciou s mind . In everyda y life on e think s ou t wha t on e wants to say, selects th e most tellin g wa y of sayin g it, an d tries to mak e one's remark s logicall y coherent . For instance , a n educate d perso n will seek to avoid a mixe d metapho r becaus e it ma y giv e a muddle d impressio n of his point . Bu t dream s have a different texture . Image s tha t seem con - tradictory an d ridiculou s crow d in o n th e dreamer, th e norma l sens e of tim e is lost, an d commonplac e thing s ca n assum e a fascinatin g or threatenin g aspect . It ma y seem strang e tha t th e unconsciou s mind shoul d orde r its materia l so differentl y from the seemingl y discipline d patter n tha t w e c a n impos e o n ou r thoughts in wakin g life. Ye t anyon e wh o stop s for a momen t to recall a drea m will b e awar e of this contrast , whic h is in fact on e of th e mai n reason s wh y th e ordinar y perso n finds dream s so har d t o understand . The y d o no t mak e sens e in term s of his norma l wakin g experience , an d therefor e h e is incline d eithe r to disregar d the m o r to confess tha t the y baffle him . Perhap s it ma y b e easie r to understan d this poin t if w e first realiz e th e fact tha t th e idea s wit h whic h w e dea l in ou r apparentl y discipline d wakin g life ar e b y n o mean s as precis e as w e like to believe . O n th e contrary , their meanin g (an d their emotiona l significanc e for us) become s mor e imprecis e th e mor e closely w e examin e them . Th e reaso n for this is tha t anythin g w e hav e hear d o r experience d ca n becom e sublimina l tha t is to say , ca n pass int o t h e unconscious. An d eve n wha t w e retai n in 39 o u r consciou s min d an d ca n reproduc e a t will h a s acquire d a n unconsciou s underton e tha t will colo r th e ide a eac h tim e it is recalled .

An d th e differenc e of meanin g is naturall y greatest whe n peopl e hav e widel y differen t social, political , religiou s o r psychologica l experiences. As lon g as concepts ar e identica l wit h mer e words, th e variatio n is almost imperceptibl e an d play s n o practica l role .

These and other influences may cause us to live in ways unsuited to our individual natures: and the psychi c imbalance that can follow must be compensate d for by the unconscious .

These Jungia n terms for huma n "types " are not dogmatic : For instance, Gandhi , right, wa s bot h an ascetic (introvert) and a political leader (extravert). A n individual—an y face in the crow d (far right) —ca n onl y more or less be categorized. adjus t him to th e "norms " o f his society . This woul d amoun t to a mos t unnatura l condition .

Becaus e psycholog y basically depend s upo n balance d opposites, n o judgmen t ca n b e considere d t o b e final in whic h its reversibilit y ha s no t bee n take n int o account . Th e reaso n for this peculiarit y lies in the fact tha t ther e is n o standpoin t abov e o r outside psycholog y tha t woul d enabl e us t o form a n ultimat e judgmen t of wha t th e psych e is. In spit e of th e fact tha t dream s deman d individua l treatment , som e generalitie s ar e necessary in orde r to classify an d clarify th e materia l tha t th e psychologist collects b y studyin g man y individuals.

Sinc e an y deepe r analysis of dream s lead s to t h e confrontatio n of tw o individuals, it will obviousl y mak e a grea t differenc e whethe r their type s of attitud e ar e th e sam e o r not .

Suc h a misunderstandin g is eas y enoug h becaus e th e valu e of th e on e is th e non-valu e of th e other.

Psychologica l experienc e an d knowledg e d o no t The "compass " of the psyche — another Jungia n wa y of looking at people in general. Each point on the compas s has its opposite : for a "thinking " type, the "feeling " side woul d be least developed . ("Feeling " here means the facult y of weighin g and evaluating experience—i n the w a y that one migh t say "I feel that is a goo d thing to do, " withou t needing to analyze or rationalize the "why " of '.he action.) Of course, there is overlapping in each individual : In a "sensation " person the thinkin g or the feeling side coul d be almost as strong (and "intuition," the opposite, woul d be weakest). Go amoun t t o mor e tha n mer e advantage s o n th e sid e of th e analyst . The y d o no t kee p hi m out - sid e th e fray, in whic h h e is boun d to b e teste d just as muc h as his patient . Thu s it matters a goo d dea l whethe r their personalitie s ar e har - monious, in conflict, o r complementary . Fxtravcrsio n an d introversio n ar e just tw o amon g man y peculiaritie s of huma n behavior . B u t the y ar c often rathe r obviou s an d easily recognizable . If on e studie s extraverte d individuals, for instance , on e soo n discovers tha t the y diffe r in man y way s from on e another , a n d tha t bein g extraverte d is therefor e a super - ficial an d to o genera l criterio n to b e reall y characteristic . Tha t is why , lon g ago , I trie d to find som e furthe r basi c peculiaritie s peculiarities tha t migh t serv e th e purpos e o f givin g som e orde r to th e apparentl y limitless variation s in huma n individuality . I ha d alway s bee n impresse d b y th e fact tha t ther e ar e a surprisin g numbe r of individuals w h o neve r us e their mind s if the y ca n avoi d it, a n d a n equa l numbe r wh o d o us e their minds, b u t in a n amazingl y stupi d way . I wa s also surprise d to find man y intelligen t an d wide - awak e peopl e wh o live d (as fa r a s on e coul d mak e out) a s if they ha d neve r learne d t o us e their sens e organs : The y di d no t se e th e thing s befor e their eyes, hea r th e word s soundin g in their ears, o r notic e th e thing s the y touche d o r tasted . Som e live d withou t bein g awar e of th e stat e of their ow n bodies. There were others who seemed to live in a most curious condition of consciousness, as if the state they had arrived at today were final, with no possibility of change, or as if the world and the psyche were static and would remain so forever. They seemed devoid of all imagination, and they entirely and exclusively depended upon their sense-perception. Chances and possibilities did not exist in their world, and in "today " there was no real "tomorrow." The future was just the repetition of the past. I am trying here to give the reader a glimpse of my own first impressions when I began to observe the many people I met. It soon became clear to me, however, that the people who used their minds were those who thought — that is, who applied their intellectual faculty in trying to adapt, themselves to people and circumstances. And the equally intelligent people who did not think were those who sought and found their way by feeling. "Feeling" is a word that needs some explanation. For instance, one speaks of "feeling" when it is a matter of "sentiment" (corresponding to the French term sentiment). But one also applies the same word to define an opinion; for example, a communication from the White House may begin: "Th e President feels . . . ." Furthermore, the word may be used to express an intuition: "I had a feeling as if. . . ." When I use the word "feeling" in contrast to "thinking," I refer to a judgment of value — for instance, agreeable or disagreeable, good or bad, and so on. Feeling according to this definition is not an emotion (which, as the word conveys, is involuntary). Feeling as I mean it is (like thinking) a rational (i.e. ordering) function, whereas intuition is an irrational (i.e. perceiving) function. In so far as intuition is a "hunch," it is not the product of a voluntary act; it is rather an involuntary event, which depends upon different external or internal circumstances instead of an act of judgment. Intuition is more like a sense-perception, which is also an irrational event in so far as it depends essentially upon objective stimuli, which owe their existence to physical and not to mental causes. These four functional types correspond to the obvious means by which consciousness obtains its orientation to experience. Sensation (i.e. sense-perception) tells you that something exists; thinking tells you what it is; feeling tells you whether it is agreeable or not; and intuition tells you whence it comes and where it is going. The reader should understand that these four criteria of types of human behavior are just four viewpoints among many others, like will power, temperament, imagination, memory, and so on. There is nothing dogmatic about them, but their basic nature recommends them as suitable criteria for a classification. I find them particularly helpful when I am called upon to explain parents to children and husbands to wives, and vice versa. They are also useful in understanding one's own prejudices. Thus , if you want to understand another person's dream, you have to sacrifice your own predilections and suppress your prejudices. This is not easy or comfortable, because it means a moral effort that is not to everyone's taste. But if the analyst does not make the effort to criticize his own standpoint (and to admit its relativity, he will get neither the right information about, nor sufficient insight into, his patient's mind. The analyst expects at least a certain willingness on the patient's part to listen to his opinion and to take it seriously, and the patient must be granted the same right. Although such a relationship is indispensable for any understanding and is therefore of self-evident necessity, one must remind oneself again and again that it is more important in therapy for the patient to understand than for the analyst's theoretical expectations to be satisfied. The patient's resistance to the analyst's interpretation is not necessarily wrong; it is rather a sure sign that something does not "click." Either the patient has not yet reached the point where he understands, or the interpretation does not fit. In our efforts to interpret the dream symbols of another person, we are almost invariabl hampered by our tendency to fill in the unavoidable gaps in our understanding by projection that is, by the assumption that what the analyst perceives or thinks is equally per6i ceive d o r though t b y th e dreamer . T o overcom e this sourc e of error, I hav e alway s insiste d o n t h e importanc e of stickin g t o th e contex t of th e particula r drea m an d excludin g all theoretica l assumption s abou t dream s in general—excep t for th e hypothesis tha t dream s in som e wa y mak e sense . It will b e clea r from all I hav e sai d tha t w e canno t la y dow n genera l rule s for interpretin g dreams . Whe n I suggeste d earlie r tha t th e overall functio n of dream s seems t o b e t o compen - sat e for deficiencie s o r distortion s in th e consciou s mind , I mean t tha t this assumptio n opene d u p th e most promisin g approac h to th e natur e of particular dreams .

Left, a down-and-ou t alcoholi c in a New York slum (from the 1 95 5 film On the Bowery). Suc h a figure migh t appear in the dreams of a ma n wh o felt himself to be superior t o others. In this wa y his unconsciou s would be compensatin g for his conscious mind' s onesidedness . Right, The Nightmare, painted by the 18th-centur y Swiss-bor n artist Henry Fuseli. Almos t everyone has been awakened , upset, or disturbed by his dreams ; our sleep does not appear to be protected from the contents of the unconscious . It is from this fact that one may understand why dreams often express themselves as analogies, why one dream image slides into another, and why neither the logic nor the time scale of our waking life seems to apply. The form that dreams take is natural to the unconscious because the material from which they are produced is retained in the subliminal state in precisely this fashion. Dreams do not guard sleep from what Freud called the "incompatible wish." What he called "disguise" is actually the shape all "impulses naturally take in the unconscious. Thus, a dream cannot produce a definite thought. If it begins to do so, it ceases to be a dream because it crosses the threshold of consciousness. That is why dreams seem to skip the very points that are most important to the conscious mind, and seem rather to manifest the "fringe of consciousness," like the faint gleam of stars during a total eclipse of the sun. We should understand that dream symbols are for the most part manifestations of a psyche that is beyond the control of the conscious mind. Meaning and purposefulness are not the prerogatives of the mind; they operate in the whole of living nature. There is no difference in principle between organic and psychic growth. As a plant produces its flower, so the psyche creates its symbols. Every dream is evidence of this process. So, by means of dreams (plus all sorts of intuitions, impulses, and other spontaneous events), instinctive forces influence the activity of consciousness. Whether that influence is for better or for worse depends upon the actual contents of the unconscious. If it contains too many things that normally ought to be conscious, then its function becomes twisted and prejudiced; motives appear that are not based upon true instincts, but that owe their existence and psychic importance to the fact that they have been consigned to the unconscious by repression or neglect. They overlay, as it were, the normal unconscious psyche and distort its natural tendency to express basic symbols and motifs. Therefore it is reasonable for a psychoanalyst, concerned with the causes of a mental disturbance, to begin by eliciting from his patient a more or less voluntary confession and realization of everything that the patient dislikes or fears. This is like the much older confession of the Church, which in many ways anticipated modern psychological techniques. At least this is the general rule. In practice, however, it may work the other way round; overpowering feelings of inferiority or serious weakness may make it very difficult, even impossible, for the patient to face fresh evidence of his own inadequacy. So I have often found it profitable to begin by giving a positive outlook to the patient; this provides a helpful sense of security when he approaches the more painful insights. Take as an example a dream of "personal exaltation" in which, for instance, one has tea with the queen of England, or finds oneself on intimate terms with the pope. If the dreamer is not a schizophrenic, the practical interpretation of the symbol depends very much upon his present state of mind — that is, the condition of his ego. If the dreamer overestimates his own value, it is easy to show (from the material produced by association of ideas) how inappropriate and childish the dreamer's intentions are, and how much they emanate from childish wishes to be equal to or superior to his parents. But if it is a case of inferiority, where an allpervading feeling of worthlessness has already overcome every positive aspect of the dreamer's personality, it would be quite wrong to depress him still more by showing how infantile, ridiculous, or even perverse he is. That would cruelly increase his inferiority, as well as cause an unwelcome and quite unnecessary resistance to the treatment. There is no therapeutic technique or doctrine that is of general application, since every case that one receives for treatment is an individual in a specific condition. I remember a patient I once had to treat over a period of nine years. Right, the heroic dreams with which Walter Mitty (in the 1947 film of JamesThurber's story) compensates his sense of inferiority. 6 4 I sa w hi m onl y for a few week s eac h year, sinc e h e live d abroad .

As this museu m display shows , the fetus of man resembles those of other animals (and thus provides an indication of man' s physical evolution ) The psyche, too, has "evolved "; and some content s of moder n man' s unconsciou s resemble product s of the min d of ancient m a n Jun g termed these product s archetypal images 66 The archetype in dream symbolism I have already suggested that dreams serve the purpose of compensation. This assumption means that the dream is a normal psychic phenomenon that transmits unconscious reactions orspontaneousimpulses to consciousness. Many dreams can be interpreted with the help of the dreamer, who provides both the associations to and the context of the dream image, by means of which one can look at all its aspects. This method is adequate in all ordinary cases, such as those when a relative, a friend, or a patient tells you a dream more or less in the course of conversation. But when it is a matter of obsessive dreaming or of highly emotional dreams, the personal associations produced by the dreamer do not usually suffice for a satisfactory interpretation. In such cases, we have to take into consideration the fact (first observed and commented on by Freud J that elements often occur in a dream that are not individual and that cannot be derived from the dreamer's personal experience. These elements, as I have previously mentioned, are what Freud called "archaic remnants" mental forms whose presence cannot be explained by anything in the individual's own life and which seem to be aboriginal, innate, and inherited shapes of the human mind. Just as the human body represents a whole museum of organs, each with a long evolutionary history behind it, so we should expect to find that the mind is organized in a similar way. It can no more be a product without history than is the body in which it exists. By "history" I do not mean the fact that the mind builds itself up by conscious reference to the past through language and other cultural traditions. I am referring to the biological, prehistoric, and unconscious development of the mind in archaic man, whose psyche was still close to that of the animal. This immensely old psyche forms the basis of our mind, just as much as the structure of our body is based on the general anatomical pattern of the mammal. The trained eye of the anatomist or the biologist finds many traces of this original pattern in our bodies. The experienced investigator of the mind can similarly see the analogies between the dream pictures of modern man and the products of the primitive mind, its "collective images," and its mythological motifs. Jus t as the biologist needs the science of comparative anatomy, however, the psychologist cannot do without a "comparative anatomy of the psyche." In practice, to put it differently, the psychologist must have a sufficient experience not only of dreams and other products of unconscious activity, but also of mythology in its widest sense. Without this equipment, nobody can spot the important analogies; it is not possible, for instance, to see the analogy between a case of compulsion neurosis and that of a classical demonic possession without a working knowledge of both. My views about the "archaic remnants," which I call "archetypes " or "primordial images," have been constantly criticized by people who lack a sufficient knowledge of the psychology of dreams and of mythology. The term "archetype " is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite mythological images or motifs. But these are nothing more than conscious representations; it would be absurd to assume that such variable representations could be inherited. The archetype is a tendency to form such representations ofa motif—representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern. There are, for instance, many representations of the motif of the hostile brethren, but the motif itself remains the same. My critics have incorrectly assumed that I am dealing with "inherited representations," and on that ground they have dismissed the idea of the archetype as mere superstition. They have 67 Man' s unconsciou s archetypal images ar e a s instinctiv e a s th e ability o f gees e t o migrat e (i n formation); a s ants' formin g organize d societies; a s bees' tail-waggin g danc e (above) tha t communicate s t o th e hiv e the exac t locatio n o f a foo d source A moder n professo r ha d a "vision " exactl y lik e a woodcu t i n a n old boo k tha t h e ha d neve r seen.

7" He r dreams have a decidedly peculiar character. Their leading thoughts are markedly philosophic in concept. Th e first one , for instance, speaks of an evil monster killing othe r animals, but Go d gives rebirth to them all through a divine Apokatastasis, or restitution. In the Western world this idea is known through the Christian tradition. It can be found in the Acts of the Apostles rn:21 : "[Christ] whom the heaven must receive until the time of restitution of all things. . . . " Th e early Greek Fathers of the Churc h (for instance, Origen) particularly insisted upo n the idea that, at the end of time, everything will be restored by the Redeeme r to its original and perfect state. But, according to St. Matthe w xvn:ll , there was already an old Jewish tradition tha t Elias "truly shall first come , an d restore all things. " I Corinthians xv:2 2 refers to the same idea in the following words: "Fo r as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be mad e alive. " O n e might guess tha t the child had encountered this thought in her religious education. But she had very little religious background . H e r parents were Protestants in name ; but in fact they knew the Bible only from hearsay. It is particularly unlikely tha t the recondite image of Apokataslasis had been fully explained to the girl. Certainly her father had never heard of this mythica l idea. Nine of the 12 dreams are influenced by the theme of destruction and restoration. An d none of these dreams shows traces of specific Christian education or influence. O n the contrary, they are mor e closely related to primitive myths. This relation is corroborated by the othe r motif—the "cosmogoni c myth " (the creation of the world and of man ) tha t appears in the fourth and fifth dreams. Th e same connec - tion is found in I Corinthians xv:22 , which I have just quoted . In this passage too, Adam a n d Christ (death and resurrection) are linked together. T h e general idea of Christ the Redeeme r belongs to the world-wide an d pre-Christ theme of the hero and rescuer who, although he has Above , the hero-go d Raven (of the Haida Indians of America' s Pacific Coast) in the belly of a whale — correspondin g to the "devourin g monster" motif in the girl's first dream (p. 70) . The girl's second dream—o f angels in hell and demon s in heaven — seems to embod y the idea of the relativity of morality. The same concep t is expressed in the dual aspect of the fallen angel wh o is bot h Satan, the devil, and (right) Lucifer, the resplendent bringer of light. These opposites can also be seen in the figure of God , far right (in a drawin g by Blake): He appears to Job , in a dream, wit h a cloven hoof like a demon's . 72 been devoured by a monster, appears again in a miraculous way, having overcome whateve r monster it was tha t swallowed him. Whe n an d where such a motif originated nobody knows. We do not even know how to go about investigating the problem. Th e one apparen t certainty is that every generation seems to have known it as a tradition hande d down from some preceding time. Thu s we can safely assume that it "originated" at a period when ma n did not yet know tha t he possessed a hero myth ; in a n age, that is to say, whe n he did not yet consciously reflect on wha t he was saying. Th e hero figure is an archetype , which has existed since time immemorial. T h e production of archetype s by children is especially significant, because one can sometimes be quit e certain tha t a child has had no direct access to the tradition concerned. In this case, the girl's family ha d no mor e tha n a superficial acquaintanc e with the Christian tradition. Christian theme s may, of course, be represented by such ideas as God , angels, heaven, hell, and evil. But the way in which they are treated by this child points to a totally non-Christian origin. Let us take the first dream of the God wh o really consists of four gods, coming from the "four corners. " Th e corners of what ? Ther e is no room mentioned in the dream. A room would not even fit in with the pictur e of wha t is obviously a cosmic event, in which the Universal Being himself intervenes. Th e quaternit y (or element of "fourness" ) itself is a strange idea, but one tha t plays a grea t role in man y religions and philosophies. In the Christian religion, it has been superseded by the Trinity, a notion tha t we must assume was known to the child. But who in an ordinary middle-class family of today would be likely to know of a divine quaternity ? It is an idea tha t was once fairly familiar amon g students of the Hermeti c philosophy in the Middl e Ages, but it petered out with the beginning of the 18th century, and it has been entirely obsolete for at least 200 years. Where , then, did the little girl pick it up ? V/jt k Dream s upon my be d tho a nearest in e ^alfngkestm e with. Vision s 73 From EzekieFs vision? But there is no Christian teaching that identifies the seraphim with God. T h e same question may he asked about the horned serpent. In the Bible, it is true, there are man y horned animals in the Book of Revelation, for instance. But all these seem to be quadruped , although their overlord is the dragon, the Greek word for which (drakon) also means serpent. The horned serpent appears in 16th-century Latin alchemy as the quadricornulus serpens four-horned serpent), a symbol of Mercur y and an antagonist of the Christian Trinity. But this is an obscure reference. So far as I can discover, it is mad e by only one author; and this child had no means of knowing it. In the second dream, a motif appears that is definitely non-Christian and that contains a reversal of accepted values for instance, paga n dances by men in heaven and good deeds by angels in hell. This symbol suggests a relativity of moral values. Wher e did the child find such a revolutionary notion, worthy of Nietzsche's genius? These questions lead us to another: Wha t is the compensatory meanin g of these dreams, to which the little girl obviously attributed so muc h importanc e that she presented them to her father as a Christma s present ? If the dreame r had been a primitive medicine man , one could reasonably assume that they represent variations of the philosophical themes ol death , of resurrection or restitution, of the origin of the world, the creation of man . and the relativity of values. But one might give up such dreams as hopelessly difficult if one tried to interpret them from a personal level. They undoubtedl y contain '"collective images. " and they are in a way analogous to the doctrines taught to young people in primitive tribes when they are abou t to be initiated as men. At such times they learn abou t wha t God , or the gods, or the "founding " animals have done , how the world and ma n were created, how the end of the world will come , an d the meanin g ol death . Is there any occasion when we, in Christian civilization, hand out similar instructions? There is: in adolescence. But man y people begin to think again of things like this in old age. at the approac h of death . The little girl, as it happened , was in both these situations. She was approachin g puberty and , at the same time, the end of her life. Little or nothing in the symbolism of her dreams The little girl's dreams (p. 70 ) contai n symbol s of creation, death, a nd rebirth, whic h resemble the teachings given to adolescent s in primitive initiation rituals. Left, the end of a Navah o ceremony : A girl, having becom e a woman , goes into the desert to meditate. Death and rebirth symbolis m also appears in dreams at the end of life, whe n the approach of death casts a shado w before it. Right, o ne of Goya' s last paintings : The strange creature, apparentl y a dog , that emerges from the dark can be interpreted as the artist's foreshadowin g of his death In many mythologie s dog s appear as guides to the land of the dead 74 points to the beginning of a norma l adult life, but there are man y allusions to destruction and restoration. Whe n I first read her dreams, indeed, I had the uncann y feeling that they suggested impendin g disaster. Th e reason I felt like that was the peculia r natur e of the compensation that I deduce d from the symbolism. It was the opposite of wha t one would expect to find in the consciousness of a girl of that age. These dreams open u p a new and rathe r terrifying aspect of life an d death. On e would expect to find such images in an aging person who looks back upon life, rathe r than to be given them by a child wh o would normally be looking forward. Their atmospher e recalls the old Roma n saying, "Life is a short dream, " rather than the joy an d exuberanc e of its springtime. For this child's life was like a ver sacrum vovendum (vow of a vernal sacrifice), as the Roma n poet puts it. Experience shows that the unknown approac h of death casts an adumbratio (an anticipatory shadow; over the life and dreams of the victim. Even the altar in Christian churche s represents, on the one hand , a tomb and , on the other, a place of resurrection the transformation of death into eternal life. Such are the ideas tha t the dreams brought home to the child. The y were a preparatio n for death , expressed through short stories, like the tales told at primitive initiations or the Koans of Zen Buddhism. This message is unlike the orthodox Christian doctrine and mor e like ancient primitive thought. It seems to have originated outside historical tradition in the long-forgotten psychic sources that, since prehistoric times, have nourished philosophical and religious speculation about life an d death . It was as if future events were casting their shadow back by arousing in the child certain thought forms that, though normally dormant , describe or accompan y the approac h of a fatal issue. Although the specific shape in which they express themselves is mor e or less personal, their general pattern is collective. The y are found everywher e and at all times, just as anima l instincts vary a good deal in the different species and yet serve the same general purposes. We do not assume tha t each new-born anima l creates its own instincts as an individual acquisition, and we must not suppose that huma n individuals invent their specific huma n ways with every new birth. Like the instincts, the collective thought patterns of the huma n mind are innat e and inherited. The y function, when the occasion arises, in mor e or less the same way in all of us. Emotiona l manifestations, to which such thought patterns belong, are recognizably the same all over the earth. We can identify them even in animals, and the animals themselves understan d one anothe r in this respect, even though they ma y belong to different species. And wha t about insects, with their complicated symbiotic functions? Most of them d o not even know their parents and have nobody to teach them. Wh y should one assume, then, tha t ma n is the only living being deprived of specific instincts, or that his psyche is devoid of all traces of its evolution? .Naturally, if you identify the psyche with consciousness, you can easily fall into the erroneous idea that ma n comes into the world with a psyche that is empty, and that in later years it contains nothing mor e than wha t it has 7.-, learned by individual experience. But the psyche is mor e than consciousness. Animals have little consciousness, but man y impulses and reactions tha t denot e the existence of a psyche ; and primitives do a lot of things whose meanin g is unknown to them. You ma y ask man y civilized people in vain for the real meanin g of the Christma s tree or of the Easter egg. Th e fact is, they d o things without knowing why they do them. I am inclined to the view tha t things were generally done first and tha t it was only a long time afterward tha t somebody asked why they were done . Th e medical psychologist is constantly confronted with otherwise intelligent patients who behave in a peculiar and unpredictabl e way and wh o have no inkling of wha t they say or do. The y ar e suddenly caught by unreasonable moods for which they themselves cannot account. Superficially, such reactions and impulses seem to be of an intimately personal nature , and so we dismiss them as idiosyncratic behavior. In fact, they ar e based upon a pre - formed an d ever-ready instinctive system that is characteristic of man . Though t forms, universally understandabl e gestures, and man y attitudes follow a patter n tha t was established long before ma n developed a reflective consciousness. It is even conceivable that the early origins of man's capacity to reflect come from the painful consequences of violent emotiona l clashes. Let me take, purely as an illustration of this point, the bushma n who, in a momen t of ange r and disappointmen t at his failure to catch any fish, strangles his muc h beloved only son, and is then seized with immens e regret as he holds the little dead body in his arms. Such a ma n might remembe r this momen t of pain for ever. We cannot know whethe r this kind of experience was actually the initial cause of the development of huma n consciousness. But there is no doub t that the shock of a similar emotional experience is often needed to make people wake up and pay attention to wha t they are doing. Ther e is a famous case of a 13thcentury Spanish hidalgo, Raimo n Lull, who finally (after a long chase) succeeded in meeting the lady he admire d at a secret rendezvous. She silently opened her dress and showed him her breast, rotten with cancer. Th e shock changed Lull's life; he eventually became an eminent theologian and one of the Church's greatest missionaries. In the case of such a sudden change one can often prove tha t an archetype has been at work for a long time in the unconscious, skillfully arrangin g circumstance s tha t will lead to the crisis. Such experiences seem to show tha t arche - typal forms ar e not just static patterns. The y are dynami c factors that manifest themselves in impulses, just as spontaneously as the instincts. Certain dreams, visions, or thoughts can suddenly appear; and however carefully one investigates, one cannot find out wha t causes them. This does not mea n tha t they have no cause ; they certainly have. But it is so remot e or obscur e tha t one cannot see wha t it is. In Som e dreams seem to predict the future (perhaps due to unconsciou s knowledg e of future possibilities); thus dreams were long used as divination . In Greece the sick woul d ask the healing go d Asklepios for a dream indicating a cure. Left, a relief depict s such a dream cure: A snake (the god' s symbol) bites a man' s diseased shoulder and the g o d (far left) heals the shoulder. Right, Constantine (an Italian painting c 1460 ) dreamin g before a battle that wa s to make him Roma n Emperor. He dreamed of the cross, a symbo l of Christ, and a voice said: "I n this sign conquer." He took the sign as his emblem , wo n the battle, and wa s thus converted to Christianity such a case, one must wait either until the dream and its meanin g are sufficiently understood, or until some external event occurs that will explai n the dream. At the momen t of the dream, this event may still lie in the future. But just as our conscious thoughts often occupy themselves with the future and its possibilities, so do the unconscious and its dreams. There has long been a general belief tha t the chief function of dreams is prognostication of the future. In antiquity, and as late as the Middl e Ages, dreams played their part in medical prognosis. I can confirm by a modern dream the element of prognosis (or precognition that can be found in an old dream rpioted by Artemidorus of Daldis, in the second century A.O . A ma n dreame d that he saw his lather die in the flames of a house on (ire. Not long afterwards, he himself died in a phlegmon? (fire, or high lexer:, which I presume was pneumonia . It so happene d that a colleague of mine was once suffering from a deadly gangrenous fever in fact, a phlegmone. A former patient of his, who had no knowledge of the natur e of his doctor's illness, dreame d that the doctor died in a great fire. At that time the doctor had just entered a hospital and the disease was only beginning. Th e dreame r knew nothing but the bare fact that his doctor was ill and in a hospital. Three weeks later, the doctor died. As this exampl e shows, dreams may have an anticipatory or prognostic aspect, and anybod y trying to interpret them must take this into consideration, especially wher e an obviously meaningful dream does not provide a context sufficient to explain it. Such a dream often comes right out of the blue, and one wonders wha t could have prompte d it. Of course, if one knew its ulterior message, its cause would be clear. For it is only our consciousness that does not yet know; the unconscious seems already informed, and to have come to a conclusion that is expressed in the dream. In fact, the unconscious seems to be able to examin e and to draw conclusions from facts, much as consciousness does. It can even use certain facts, and anticipat e their possible results, just because we are not conscious of them. But as far as one can mak e out from dreams, the unconscious makes its deliberations instinctively. The distinction is important. Logical analysis is the prerogative of consciousness; we select with reason an d knowledge. The unconscious, however, seems to be guided chiefly by instinctive trends, represented by corresponding thought forms that is. by the archetypes. A doctor who is asked to describe the course of an illness will use such rational concepts as "infection" or "fever. " The dream is more poetic. It presents the diseased body as a man's earthly house, and the fever as the fire that is destroying it. As the above dream shows, the archetypa l mind has handled the situation in the same way as it did in the time of Artemidorus. Something that is of a more or less unknown natur e has been intuitively grasped In the unconscious and submitted to an archetypa l treatment. This suggests that, instead of the process of reasoning that conscious thought would have applied, the archetypa l mind has stepped in and taken over In a dream quote d from Artemidoru s on this page, a burnin g house symbolizes a fever The huma n bod y is often represented as a house: Left, from an 18th-centur y Hebre w encyclopedia , the bod y and a house are compare d in detail—turret s as ears, window s as eyes, a furnace as stomach , etc. Right, in a cartoon by James Thurber, a henpecke d husban d sees his hom e and his wif e as the same being the task of prognostication. The archetype s thus have their own initiative and their own specific energy. Thes e powers enabl e them both to produce a meaningful interpretation (in their own symbolic style) and to interfere in a given situation with their own impulses and their own thought formations. In this respect, they function like complexes; they come and go very much as they please, an d often they obstruct or modify our conscious intentions in an embarrassing way. We can perceive the specific energv of archetypes when we experience the peculiar fascination that accompanie s them. The y seem to hold a special spell. Such a peculiar quality is also characteristic ol the personal complexes; and just as personal complexes have their individual history, so do social complexes of an archetypal character. But while personal complexes never produc e mor e than a personal bias, archetypes create myths, religions, and philosophies that influence and characteriz e whole nations and epochs of history. We regard the personal complexes as compensations for onesided or faulty attitude s of consciousness; in the saine way. myths of a religious natur e can be interpreted as a sort of menta l therapy for the sufferings and anxieties of mankin d in general hunger, war, disease, old age, death. The universal hero myth, lot example , always refers to a powerful ma n or god-ma n who vanquishes evil in the form of dragons, serpents, monsters, demons, and so on, and who liberates his people from destruction and death, fhe narration or ritual repetition of sacred texts and ceremonies, and the worship of such a figure with dances, music, hymns, prayers, and sacrifices, grip the audienc e with numinous emotions (as if with magic spells) and exalt the individual to an identification with the hero. II we try to see such a situation with the eyes of a believer, we can perhaps understand how the ordinary ma n can be liberated from his personal impotenc e and misery and endowed (at least temporarily) with an almost superhuma n quality. Often enough such a conviction will sustain him for a long time and give a certain style to his life. It ma y even set the tone of a whole society. A remarkabl e instance of this can be found in the Eleusinian mysteries, which were finally suppressed at the beginning of the seventh century of the Christian era. They expressed, together with the Delphic oracle, the essence and spirit of ancient Greece . O n a muc h greater scale, the Christian era itself owes its name and significance to the antique mystery of the god-man . which has its roots in the archetypa l Osiris-Horus myth of ancient Egypt. It is commonl y assumed that on some given occasion in prehistoric times, the basic mythological ideas were "invented " by a clever old philosopher or prophet, and ever afterward "believed " by a credulous and uncritical people. It is said that stories told by a powerseeking priesthood are not "true. " but merely "'wishful thinking. " But the very word "invent " is derived from the Latin invenirt, and means to "iind " and hence to find something by •"seeking " it. In the latter case the word itself hints at some foreknowledge of what you are going to find. The energy of archetypes can be focused (throug h rituals and other appeals to mass emotion ) to mov e people to collective action The Nazis kne w this, and used versions of Teutonic myth s to help rally the countr y to their cause Far right, a propaganda paintin g of Hitler as a heroic crusader; right, a solstice festival celebrated in summer by the Hitler Youth , a revival of an ancient pagan festival 8o Top, a child' s paintin g o f Christmas include s th e familia r tre e decorated wit h candles. Th e evergree n tre e is connecte d wit h Chris t throug h the symbolis m o f th e winte r solstice an d th e "ne w year " (th e ne w aeo n of Christianity ) Ther e ar e man y links betwee n Chris t an d th e tre e symbol : Th e cros s i s ofte n see n a s a tree, a s i n a medieval Italia n fresco, left, o f Chris t crucifie d o n th e tree o f knowledge . Candle s i n Christian ceremonie s symboliz e divin e light, as in the Swedis h festival of St Lucia (above), wher e girl s wea r crown s of burnin g candles. Let me go back to the strange ideas contained in the dreams of the little girl. It seems unlikely tha t she sought them out, since she was surprised to find them. The y occurred to he r rather as peculiar an d unexpected stories, which seemed noteworthy enough to be given to her father as a Christma s present. In doing so, however, she lifted them u p into the sphere of our still living Christian mystery—th e birth of our Lord, mixed with the secret of the evergreen tree tha t carries the new-bor n Light. (This is the reference of the fifth dream.) Although there is ampl e historical evidence for the symbolic relation between Christ and the tree symbol, the little girl's parents would have been gravely embarrassed had they been asked to explain exactly wha t they mean t by decorating a tree with burnin g candles to celebrate the nativity of Christ. "Oh , it's just a Christmas custom! " they would have said. A serious answe r would requir e a far-reaching dissertation abou t the antiqu e symbolism of the dying god, and its relation to the cult of the Great Mothe r and her symbol, the tree—to mention only one aspect of this complicated problem. f T h e further we delve into the origins of a "collective image " (or, to express it in ecclesiastical language , of a dogma), the mor e we uncover a seemingly unendin g web of archetypa l patterns that, before moder n times, were never the object of conscious reflection. Thus, para - doxically enough, we know mor e abou t mytho - logical symbolism tha n did any generation before our own. Th e fact is tha t in former times men did not reflect upo n their symbols; they lived them an d were unconsciously animate d by their meaning . I will illustrate this by an experience I once had with the primitives of Moun t Elgon in Africa. Every mornin g at dawn , they leave their huts and breath e or spit into their hands, which they then stretch out to the first rays of the sun, as if they were offering either their breat h or their spittle to the rising god — to mungu. (This Swahili word, which they used in explaining the ritual act, is derived from a Polynesian root equivalent to mana or mulungu. Thes e and similar terms designate a "power " of extraordinary efficiency an d pervasiveness, which we should call divine. Thu s the word mungu is their equivalent for Allah or God.) Whe n I asked them wha t they mean t by this act, or why they did it, they were completely baffled. The y could only say: "W e have always done it. It has always been don e whe n the sun rises." The y laughed at the obvious conclusion tha t the sun is mungu. Th e sun indeed is not mungu whe n it is above the horizon ; mungu is the actua l momen t of the sunrise. Wha t they were doing was obvious to me, b ut not to them; they just did it, never reflecting on wha t they did. The y were consequently unabl e to explain themselves. I concluded tha t they were offering their souls to mungu, because the breat h (of life) and the spittle mea n "soul-substance. " T o breathe or spit upon something conveys a "magical " effect, as, for instance, whe n Christ used spittle to cure the blind, or wher e a son inhales his dying father's last breat h in orde r to take over the father's soul. It is most unlikely tha t these Africans ever, even in the remot e past, knew any mor e abou t the meanin g of their ceremony. In fact, their ancestors probabl y knew even less, because they were even mor e profoundly unconscious of their motives an d though t less abou t their doings. Goethe's Faust aptly says: "Im Anfang war die Tat [In the beginning was the deed]. " "Deeds " were never invented, they were done ; thoughts, on the other hand , are a relatively late discovery of man . First he was moved to deeds by unconscious factors; it was only a long time afterward tha t he began to reflect upon the causes tha t had moved him; and it took him a very long time indeed to arrive at the preposterous idea tha t he must have moved himself—his mind being unabl e to identify any othe r motivating force than his own. We should laugh at the idea of a plant or an anima l inventing itself, yet there are man y people who believe tha t the psyche or mind invented itself and thus was the creator of its own existence. As a matte r of fact, the mind has grown to its present state of consciousness as an acorn grows into an oak or as saurians 81 developed into mammals. As it has for so long been developing, so it still develops, and thus we are moved by forces from within as well as by stimuli from without. Thes e inner motives spring from a deep source tha t is not mad e by consciousness and is not unde r its control. In the mythology of earlier times, these forces were called mana, or spirits, demons, an d gods. The y ar e as active today as they ever were. If they conform to our wishes, we call them happ y hunche s or impulses and pa t ourselves on the back for being smart fellows. If they go against us, then we say tha t it is just bad luck, or tha t certain people are against us, or tha t the cause of our misfortunes must be pathological. Th e one thing we refuse to admit is tha t we are dependen t upon "powers " tha t are beyond our control. It is true, however, tha t in recent times civilized ma n has acquired a certain amoun t of will power, which he can apply wher e he pleases. He has learned to do his work efficiently without having recourse to chantin g and drummin g to hypnotiz e him into the state of doing. Hecan even dispense with a daily praye r for divine aid. He can carry out wha t he proposes to do, and he can apparentl y translate his ideas into action without a hitch, wherea s the primitive seems to be hampere d at each step by fears, superstitions, and othe r unseen obstacles to action. Th e motto "Wher e there's a will, there's a way " is the superstition of moder n man . Yet in orde r to sustain his creed, contemporary ma n pays the price in a remarkabl e lack of introspection. He is blind to the fact that, with all his rationality and efficiency, he is possessed by "powers " tha t are beyond his control. His gods and demon s have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names. They keep him on the run with restlessness, vague apprehensions, psychological complications, an insatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food and , above all, a large array of neuroses. T w o examples of belief in the "magical" gualit y of breath: Belo w left, a Zulu witc h doctor cures a patient by blowin g into his ear throug h a cow' s horn (to drive the spirits out) ; below , a medieval painting of the creation depict s G o d breathing life into Adam . Right, in a 13th-centur y Italian painting, Christ heals a blind man wit h spittle—which , like breath, has long been believed to have a lifegivin g ability The soul of man What we call civilized consciousness has steadily separated itself from the basic instincts. But these instincts have not disappeared. The y have merely lost their contac t with our consciousness and are thus forced to assert themselves in an indirect fashion. This may be by means of physical symptoms in the case of a neurosis, or by means of incidents of various kinds, such as unaccountable moods, unexpected forgetfulness, or mistakes in speech. A man likes to believe that he is the master of his soul. But as long as he is unabl e to control his moods and emotions, or to be conscious of the myriad secret ways in which unconscious factors insinuate themselves into his arrange - ments and decisions, he is certainly not his own master. These unconscious factors owe their existence to the autonomy of the archetypes. Modern man protects himself against seeing his own split state by a system of compartments. Certain areas of oute r life and of his own behavior are kept, as it were, in separat e drawers and arc never confronted with one another. As an exampl e of this so-called compartmen t psychology, I remembe r the case of an alcoholic who had come unde r the laudabl e influence of a certain religious movement, and , fascinated by its enthusiasm, had forgotten that he needed a drink. He was obviously and miraculously cured by Jesus, and he was correspondingly displayed as a witness to divine grac e or to the efficiency of the said religious organization. But after a few weeks of public confessions, the novelty began to pale and some alcoholic refreshment seemed to be indicated, and so he drank again. But this time the helpful organization came to the conclusion tha t the case was "pathological " and obviously not suitable for an intervention by Jesus, so they put him into a clinic to let the doctor do better than the div ine healer. This is an aspect of the moder n "cultural " mind that is worth looking into. It shows an «3 84 alarming degree of dissociation an d psychological confusion. If, for a moment, we regard mankin d as one individual, we see tha t the huma n race is like a person carried awa y by unconscious powers; and the huma n race also likes to keep certain problems tucked awa y in separat e drawers. But this is why we should give a grea t deal of consideration to wha t we are doing, for mankin d is now threatened by self-created an d deadly dangers tha t are growing beyond our control. Our world is, so to speak, dissociated like a neurotic, with the Iron Curtai n markin g the symbolic line of division. Western man , becoming aware of the aggressive will to powe r of the East, sees himself forced to take extraordinary measures of defense, at the same time as he prides himself on his virtue and good intentions. Wha t he fails to see is tha t it is his own vices, which he has covered u p by good internationa l manners, tha t are thrown back in his face by the communist world, shamelessly and methodically. Wha t the West has tolerated, but secretly and with a slight sense of shame (the diplomatic lie, systematic deception, veiled threats), comes back into the open and in full measure from the East and ties us u p in neurotic knots. It is the face of his own evil shadow that grins at Western ma n from the other side of the Iron Curtain. It is this state of affairs tha t explains the peculiar feeling of helplessness of so man y people in Western societies. The y have begun to realize tha t the difficulties confronting us are moral problems, and tha t the attempts to answer them by a policy of piling u p nuclea r arms or by economic "competition " is achieving little, for it cuts both ways. Man y of us now understand tha t mora l an d menta l means would be mor e efficient, since they could provide us with psychic immunit y against the everincreasing infection. "Our world is dissociated like a neurotic." Left, the Berlin Wall. But all such attempts have proved singularly ineffective, and will do so as long as we try to convince ourselves and the world tha t it is only they (i.e. our opponents) who are wrong, ft would be muc h mor e to the point for us to make a serious attemp t to recognize our own shadow and its nefarious doings. If we could see our shadow (the dark side of our nature), we should be immun e to any mora l and menta l infection an d insinuation. As matters now stand, we lay ourselves open to every infection, because we are really doing practically the same thing as they. Onl y we have the additional disadvantage tha t we neither see nor wan t to understan d wha t we ourselves are doing, unde r the cover of good manners. T h e communist world, it ma y be noted, has one big myt h (which we call an illusion, in the vain hope tha t our superior judgmen t will make it disappear). It is the time-hallowed archetypa l dream of a Golden Age (or Para - dise), wher e everything is provided in abund - ance for everyone, and a great, just, and wise chief rules over a huma n kindergarten. This powerful archetype in its infantile form has gripped them, but it will never disappea r from the world at the mer e sight of our superior point of view. We even support it by our own childishness, for our Western civilization is in the grip of the same mythology. Unconsciously, we cherish the same prejudices, hopes, and expectations. We too believe in the welfare state, in universal peace, in the equality of man , in his eternal huma n rights, in justice, truth, and (do not say it too loudly) in the Kingdom of Go d on Earth . T h e sad truth is tha t man's real life consists of a complex of inexorabl e opposites—day and night, birth an d death, happiness an d misery, good an d evil. We are not even sure tha t one will prevail against the other, tha t good will overcome evil, or joy defeat pain. Life is a battleground . It always has been, and always will be ; and if it were not so, existence would come to an end. It was precisely this conflict within ma n tha t led the early Christians to expect an d hope for an early end to this world, or the Buddhists to 85 Every society has its idea of the archetypal paradise or golden age that, it is believed, once existed and wil l exist again. Left, a 19th - centur y America n painting embodies the idea of a past Utopia: It show s Willia m Penn's treaty wit h the Indians in 168 2 occurring in an ideal setting wher e all is harmony and peace. Belo w left, a reflection of the idea of a Utopia yet to come : A poster in a Mosco w park show s Lenin leading the Russian people towar d the future Above , the Garden of Eden, depicted as a walled (and womb-like ) garden in a 1 5th-century'Frenc h painting and showin g the expulsion of Ada m and Eve. Right, a "golde n age " of primitive naturalness is pictured in a 16th-centur y painting by Cranach (entitled Earthly Paradise). Far right, the 1 6th-centur y Flemish artist Brueghel's Land of Cokaygne, a mythical land of sensual delight s and easy living.(stories of whic h were widel y popular in medieval Europe, especially amon g the hardworkin g peasants and serfs). reject all earthly desires an d aspirations. Thes e basic answers would be frankly suicidal if they were not linked u p with peculiar menta l an d moral ideas and practices tha t constitute the bulk of both religions an d that, to a certain extent, modify their radical denial of the world. I stress this point because, in our time, there are millions of people wh o have lost faith in any kind of religion. Such people do not understand their religion any longer. Whil e life runs smoothly without religion, the loss remains as good as unnoticed. But whe n suffering comes, it is another matter. Tha t is whe n people begin to seek a way out an d to reflect abou t the meaning of life and its bewildering an d painful experiences. It is significant that the psychological doctor (within my experience) is consulted mor e by Jews and Protestants than by Catholics. This might be expected, for the Catholi c Churc h still feels responsible for the cura animarum (the care an d welfare of souls). But in this scientific age, the psychiatrist is apt to be asked the questions that once belonged in the domai n of the theologian. People feel tha t it makes, or would make, a grea t difference if only they had a positive belief in a meaningful way of life or in God and immortality. Th e specter of ap - proaching death often gives a powerful incentive to such thoughts. From time immemorial, men have had ideas abou t a Supreme Being (one or several) an d abou t the Lan d of the Hereafter. Onl y today do they think they can d o without such ideas. Because we cannot discover God's throne in the sky with a radio telescope or establish (for certain) tha t a beloved father or mothe r is still abou t in a mor e or less corporea l form, people assume tha t such ideas are "no t true. " I would rathe r say tha t they are not "true " enough, for these are conceptions of a kind tha t have accompanie d huma n life from pre - historic times, and tha t still break through into consciousness at any provocation. Moder n ma n ma y assert tha t he can dispense with them, an d he ma y bolster his opinion by insisting that there is no scientific evidence of their truth. O r he may even regret the loss of his convictions. But since we are dealing with invisible and unknowabl e things (for Go d is beyond huma n understanding, an d ther e is no mean s of proving immortality), why should we bothe r abou t evidence? Even if we did not know by reason our need for salt in our food, we should nonetheless profit from its use. We might argue tha t the use of salt is a mer e illusion of taste or a superstition; but it would still contribut e to our well-being. Why , then, should we deprive ourselves of views tha t would prove helpful in crises and would give a meanin g to our existence? A n d how do we know tha t such ideas are not true ? Man y people would agree with me 87 if I stated flatly that such ideas are probabl y illusions. Wha t they fail to realize is tha t the denial is as impossible to "prove " as the assertion of religious belief. We ar e entirely free to choose which point of view we take ; it will in an y case be an arbitrar y decision. Ther e is, however, a strong empirical reason why we should cultivate thoughts tha t can never be proved. It is tha t they are known to be useful. Ma n positively needs general ideas and convictions tha t will give a meanin g to his life an d enabl e him to find a place for himself in the universe. H e can stand the most incredible hardships when he is convinced that they make sense; he is crushed when, on top of all his misfortunes, he has to admit tha t he is taking part in a "tal e told by an idiot. " It is the role of religious symbols to give a meaning to the life of man . Th e Pueblo Indians believe tha t they are the sons of Father Sun, and this belief endows their life with a perspective (and a goal) tha t goes far beyond their limited existence. It gives them ample space for the unfolding of personality and permits them a full life as complet e persons. Their plight is infinitely mor e satisfactory than tha t of a ma n in our own civilization who knows tha t he is (and will remain) nothing more tha n an underdo g with no inner meaning to his life. A sense of a wider meanin g to one's existence is wha t raises a ma n beyond mer e getting and spending. If he lacks this sense, he is lost and miserable. Ha d St. Paul been convinced tha t he was nothing mor e than a Left, the burial coffin of a Sout h American Cayapas Indian. The dead man is provided wit h foo d and clothing for his life after death. Religious symbol s and beliefs of every kind give meaning to men' s lives ancient peoples grieved over death (right, an Egyptian figurine representing mourning , whic h wa s found in a tomb) ; yet their beliefs made them also think of death as a positive transformation. wanderin g tent-make r he certainly would not have been the ma n he was. His real and meaningful life lay in the inne r certainty tha t he was the messenger of the Lord. On e may accuse him of suffering from megalomania , but this opinion pales before the testimony of history and the judgmen t of subsequent generations. Th e myth that took possession of him mad e him something greater than a mer e craftsman. Such a myth, however, consists of symbols that have not been invented consciously. The y have happened . It was not the ma n Jesus who created the myth of the god-man . It existed for man y centuries before his birth. He himself was seized by this symbolic idea, which, as St. Mar k tells us, lifted him out of the narrow life of the Nazaren e carpenter. Myths go back to the primitive storyteller and his dreams, to men moved by the stirring of their fantasies. Thes e people were not very different from those whom later generations have called poets or philosophers. Primitive storytellers did not concern themselves with the origin of their fantasies; it was very muc h later tha t people began to wonde r where a story originated. Vet. centuries ago, in what we now call "ancient"" Greece, men's minds were advance d enough t o surmise that the tales of the gods were nothing but archai c and exaggerated traditions o f long-buried kings or chieftains. Me n already too k th e view that the myth was too improbabl e to mea n what it said. The y therefore tried to reduc e it to a generally understandabl e form. In mor e recent times, we have seen the same thing happe n with dream symbolism. We became aware , in the years when psychology was in its infancy, that dreams had some importance . But just as the Greeks persuaded themselves tha t their myths were merely elaborations of rational or "normal " history, so some of the pioneers of psychology came to the conclusion tha t dreams did not mea n wha t they appeare d to mean . Th e images or symbols that they presented were dismissed as bizarre forms in which repressed contents o f the psyche appeared to the consciou s mind. It thus came to be taken for granted that a dream meant something othe r tha n its obvious statement. I have already described my disagreement with this idea — a disagreement that led mc to study the form as well as the content of dreams. Wh y should they mea n something different from their contents ? Is there anything in natur e that is othe r than it is? Th e dream is a norma l an d natura l phenomenon , and it does not mea n something it is not. Th e Talmu d even says: "Th e dream is its own interpretation. " Th e confusion arises because the dream's contents ar e symbolic an d thus have mor e than one meaning. Th e symbols point in different directions from those we apprehen d with the conscious mind ; and therefore they relate to something either unconscious or at least not entirely conscious. Above , a child' s drawin g of a tree (wit h the sun above it). A tree is o ne of the best examples of a motif that often appears in dreams (and elsewhere) and that can have an incredible variety of meanings . It migh t symbolize evolution, physical growth , or psychological maturation ; it migh t symbolize sacrifice or death (Christ's crucifixion on the tree); it migh t be a phallic symbol ; it migh t be a great deal more. An d such other commo n dream motif s as the cross (right) or the lingam (far right) can also have a vast array of symboli c meanings . ' I " T o the scientific mind, such phenomen a as symbolic ideas are a nuisance because they cannot be formulated in a way that is satisfactory to intellect and logic. The y are by no means the only case of this kind in psychology. T h e trouble begins with the phenomeno n of "affect" or emotion, which evades all the attempts of the psychologist to pin it down with a final definition. Th e cause of the difficulty is the same in both cases — the intervention of the unconscious. I know enough of the scientific point of view to understand tha t it is most annoyin g to have to deal with facts tha t cannot be completely or adequately grasped. Th e troubl e with these phenomen a is tha t the facts are undeniable and yet canno t be formulated in intellectual terms. For this one would have to be able to comprehen d life itself, for it is life that produces emotions an d symbolic ideas. T h e academi c psychologist is perfectly free to dismiss the phenomeno n of emotion or the concept of the unconscious (or both) from his consideration. Yet they remain facts to which the medical psychologist at least has to pay due attention ; for emotiona l conflicts an d the intervention of the unconscious are the classical features of his science. If he treats a patient at all, he comes up against these irrationalities as hard facts, irrespective of his ability to formulate them in intellectual terms. It is. therefore, epiite natura l that people who have not had the medical psychologist's experience find it difficult to follow wha t happen s when psychology ceases to be a tranquil pursuit for the scientist in his laboratory and becomes an active part of the adventur e of real life. Target practice on a shooting range is far from the battlefield; the doctor has to deal with casualties in a genuine war. He must concern himself with psychic realities, even if he cannot embod y them in scientific definitions. Tha t is why no textbook can teach psychology; one learns only by actua l experience. We can see this point clearly when we examin e certain well-known symbols: T h e cross in the Christian religion, for instance, is a meaningful symbol tha t expresses a multitude of aspects, ideas, and emotions: but a cross after a name on a list simply indicates that the individual is dead. Th e phallus functions as an all-embracing symbol in the Hind u religion, but if a street urchin draws one on a wall, it just reflects an interest in his penis. Because infantile and adolescent fantasies often continue far into adult life, many dreams occur in which there are unmistakabl e sexual allusions. It would be absurd to under9 i stand them as anythin g else. But whe n a mason speaks of monks and nuns to be laid upo n each other, or an electrician of mal e plugs and female sockets, it would be ludicrous to suppose tha t he is indulging in glowing adolescent fantasies. He is simply using colorful descriptive name s for his materials. Whe n an educated Hind u talks to you abou t the ling am (the phallus tha t represents the god Siva in Hind u mythology), you will hea r things we Westerners would never connect with the penis. Th e lingam is certainly not an obscene allusion; nor is the cross merely a sign of death. Muc h depends upo n the maturit y of the dreame r wh o produce s such an image . T h e interpretation of dreams an d symbols demand s intelligence. It cannot be turne d into a mechanica l system and then cramme d into unimaginative brains. It demand s both an increasing knowledge of the dreamer's individuality and an increasing self-awareness on the part of the interpreter. No experienced worker in this field will deny tha t there are rules of thum b tha t can prove helpful, but they must be applied with prudenc e an d intelligence. O n e ma y follow all the right rules and yet get bogged down in the most appalling nonsense, simply by overlooking a seemingly unimportan t detail tha t a better intelligence would not have missed. Even a ma n of high intellect can go badly astray for lack of intuition or feeling. Whe n we attemp t to understan d symbols, we are not only confronted with the symbol itself, but we are brough t u p against the wholeness of the symbol-producing individual. This includes a study of his cultural background, and in the process one fills in man y gaps in one's own education. I have mad e it a rule myself to consider every case as an entirely new proposition abou t which I do not even know the ABC. Routin e responses may be practical and useful while one is dealing with the surface, but as soon as one gets in touch with the vital problems, life itself takes over and even the most brilliant theoretical premises become ineffectual words. Imaginatio n and intuition are vital to our understanding. An d though the usual popula r opinion is tha t they are chiefly valuabl e to poets an d artists (that in "sensible " matters one should mistrust them), they are in fact equally vital in all the highe r grades of science. Her e they play an increasingly importan t role, which supplements tha t of the "rational " intellect and its application to a specific problem. Even physics, the strictest of all applied sciences, depends to an astonishing degree upo n intuition, which works by way of the unconscious (although it is possible to demonstrat e afterward the logical procedure s tha t could have led one to the same result as intuition). Intuition is almost indispensable in the interpretation of symbols, an d it can often ensure tha t they are immediately understood by the dreamer. But while such a lucky hunc h ma y be subjectively convincing, it can also be rathe r dangerous. It can so easily lead to a false feeling of security. It may, for instance, seduce both the interprete r and the dreame r into continuing a cosy an d relatively easy relation, which ma y end in a sort of shared dream. T h e safe basis of real intellectual knowledge and mora l understandin g gets lost if one is content with the vague satisfaction of having understood by "hunch. " On e can explain and know only if one has reduced intuitions to an exact knowledge of facts and their logical connections. An honest investigator will have to admit tha t he cannot always do this, but it would be dishonest not to keep it always in mind. Even a scientist is a huma n being. So it is natura l for him, like others, to hat e the things he cannot explain. It is a commo n illusion to believe tha t wha t we know today is all we ever can know. Nothin g is mor e vulnerabl e than scientific theory, which is an ephemera l attemp t to explain facts and not an everlasting truth in itself. 9 2 Ancient mythological beings are now curiosities in museums (right). But the archetypes they expressed have not lost their power to affect men's minds. Perhaps the monsters of modern "horror" films (far right) are distorted versions of archetypes that will no longer be repressed. The role of symbols When the medical psychologist takes an interest in symbols, he is primarily concerned with "natural " symbols, as distinct from "cultural " symbols. Th e former ar e derived from the unconscious contents of the psyche, and they therefore represent an enormous numbe r of variations on the essential archetypa l images. In man y cases they can still be traced back to their archai c roots i.e. to ideas and images that we meet in the most ancient records and in primitive societies. Th e cultura l symbols, on the other hand , are those tha t have been used to express "eterna l truths, " an d tha t are still used in man y religions. The y have gone through man y transformations an d even a long process of mor e or less conscious development, and have thus become collective images accepted by civilized societies. Such cultural symbols nevertheless retain much of their original numinosity or "spell. " O n e is awar e that they can evoke a dee p emotional response in some individuals, and this psychic change makes them function in muc h the same way as prejudices. The y are a factor with which the psychologist must reckon; it is folly to dismiss them because, in rational terms, they seem to be absurd or irrelevant. The y are important constituents of our menta l make-u p a n d vital forces in the building u p of huma n society; and they cannot be eradicated without serious loss. Wher e they ar e repressed or neglected, their specific cnergv disappears into the unconscious with unaccountabl e consequences. T h e psychic energy tha t appears to have been lost in this way in fact serves to revive and intensify whateve r is uppermost in the unconscious— tendencies, perhaps, that have hitherto had no chanc e to express themselves or at least have not been allowed an uninhibited existence in our consciousness. Such tendencies form an ever-present and potentially destructive "shadow " to our conscious mind. Even tendencies that might in some circumstances be able to exert a beneficial influence are transformed into demons when they are repressed. This is why man y wellmeanin g people are understandabl y afraid of the unconscious, and incidentally of psychology. O u r times have demonstrate d wha t it means for the gates of the underworld to be opened. Things whose enormity nobody could have imagined in the idyllic harmlessness of the first decade of our century have happene d and have turned our world upside down . Ever since, the world has remained in a state of schizophrenia. Not only has civilized German y disgorged its 93 terrible primitivity, but Russia is also ruled by it, and Africa has been set on fire. No wonde r tha t the Western world feels uneasy. Moder n ma n does not understan d how muc h his "rationalism" (which hasdestroyed his capa - city to respond to numinou s symbols and ideas I has put him at the mercy of the psychic "underworld. " He has freed himself frqm "superstition" (orsoh e believes), but in the process he has lost his spiritual values to a positively dangerous degree. His moral and spiritual tradition has disintegrated, and he is now paying the price for this break-u p in world-wide disorientation and dissociation. Anthropologists have often described wha t happens to a primitive society when its spiritual values are exposed to the impac t of modern civilization. Its people lose the meanin g of their lives, theirsocial organization disintegrates, and they themselves morally decay. We are now in the same condition. But we have never really understood wha t we have lost, for our spiritual leaders unfortunately were mor e interested in protecting their institutions than in understanding the mystery that symbols present. In my opinion, faith docs not exclude thought (which is man's strongest weapon), but unfortunately man y believers seem to be so afraid of science (and incidentally of psychology) that they turn a blind eye to the numinou s psychic powers that forever control man's fate. We have stripped all things of their mystery and numinosity : nothing is holy any longer. In earlier ages, as instinctive concepts welled u p in the mind of man , his conscious mind could no doubt integrate them into a coherent psychic pattern. But the "civilized" ma n is no longer able to do this. His "advanced " consciousness has deprived itself of the means by which the auxiliary contributions of the instincts and the unconscious can be assimilated. These organs of assimilation and integration were numinou s symbols, held holy by commo n consent. Today , for instance, we talk of "matter. " We describe its physical properties. We conduct laboratory experiments to demonstrat e some ol its aspects. But the word "matter " remains a dry, inhuman , and purely intellectual concept, without any psychic significance for us. How different was the former image of matte r the Great Mothe r that could encompass and cx94 press the profound emotiona l meanin g of Mothe r Earth . In the same way, wha t was the spirit is now identified with intellect and thus ceases to be the Fathe r of All. It has degenerated to the limited ego-thoughts of man ; the immense emotiona l energy expressed in the image of "ou r Father " vanishes into the sand of an intellectual desert. These two archetypa l principles lie at the foundation of the contrasting systems of East and West. Th e masses an d their leaders do not realize, however, tha t ther e is no substantial difference between calling the world principle male and a father (spirit), as the West does, or female an d a mothe r (matter), as the Communists do. Essentially, we know as little of the one as of the other. In earlier times, these principles were worshiped in all sorts of rituals, which at least showed the psychic significance they held for man . But now they have become mere abstract concepts. As scientific understandin g has grown, so our world has become dehumanized . Ma n feels himself isolated in the cosmos, because he is no longer involved in natur e and has lost his emotional "unconscious identity " with natura l phenomena. These have slowly lost their symbolic implications. Thunde r is no longer the voice of an angry god, nor is lightning his avenging missile. No river contains a spirit, no tree is the life principle of a man , no snake the embodiment of wisdom, no mountai n cave the home of a great demon . No voices now speak to man from stones, plants, and animals, nor does he speak to them believing they can hear. His contact with natur e has gone, and with it has gone the profound emotiona l energy that this symbolic connection supplied. This enormou s loss is compensated for by the symbols of our dreams. The y bring up our original natur e its instincts and peculiar thinking. Unfortunately, however, they express their contents in the language of nature , which is strange and incomprehensibl e to us. It therefore confronts us with the task of translating it into the rational words and concepts of moder n speech, which has liberated itself from its primitive encumbrance s notably from its mystical participation with the things it describes. Nowadays, when we talk of ghosts and othe r numinous figures, we are no longer conjuring them up. 'The powe r as well as the glory is drained out of such once-potent words. We have ceased to believe in magic formulas; not man y taboos and similar restrictions are left; and our world seems to be disinfected of all such "superstitious " minima as "witches, warlocks, and worricows, " to say nothing ol werewolves, vampires, bush souls, and all the othe r bizarre beings that populated the primeval forest. T o be mor e accurate , the surface of our world seems to be cleansed ol all superstitious and irrational elements. Whether, however, the real inner huma n worl d mil inn wish-fullilling 95 Repressed unconsciou s content s can erupt destructively in the form of negative emotion s as in Worl d War II Far left, Jewis h prisoners in Warsaw after the 1 943 uprising; left, footwear of the dead stacked at Auschwitz . Right, Australian aborigines wh o have disintegrated since they lost their religious beliefs throug h contact wit h civilization This tribe now numbers only a few hundre d fiction abou t it) is also freed from primitivity is anothe r question. Is the numbe r 13 not still taboo for man y people? Ar e there not still man y individuals possessed by irrationa l prejudices, projections, and childish illusions? A realistic picture of the huma n mind reveals man y such primitive traits an d survivals, which are still playing their roles just as if nothing ha d happene d durin g the last 500 years. It is essential to appreciat e this point. Moder n m a n is in fact a curious mixtur e of characteristics acquired over the long ages of his menta l development. This mixed-u p being is the ma n and his symbols tha t we have to deal with, and we must scrutinize his menta l products very carefully indeed. Skepticism and scientific conviction exist in him side by side with old-fashioned prejudices, outdate d habits of thought and feeling, obstinat e misinterpretations, and blind ignorance . Such are the contemporar y huma n beings who produc e the symbols we psychologists investigate. In orde r to explain these symbols and their meaning , it is vital to learn whethe r their representations are related to purely personal experience, or whethe r they have been chosen by a dream for its particula r purpos e from a store of general conscious knowledge . Take , for instance, a dream in which the numbe r 13 occurs. Th e question is whethe r the dreame r himself habitually believes in the unlucky quality of the number, or whethe r the dream merely alludes to people wh o still indulge in such superstitions. Th e answer makes a grea t difference to the interpretation. In the former case, you have to reckon with the fact tha t the individua l is still unde r the spell of the unlucky 13, an d therefore will feel most uncomfortable in Room 13 in a hotel or sitting at a table with 13 people. In the latter case, 13 may not mea n any mor e than a discourteous or abusive remark. Th e "superstitious " dreame r still feels the "spell " of 13; the mor e "rational " dreame r has stripped 13 of its original emotional overtones. This argumen t illustrates the way in which archetype s appea r in practica l experience : The y are, at the same time, both images an d emotions. On e can speak of an archetype only whe n these two aspects are simultaneous. Whe n there is merely the image , then there is simply a word-pictur e of little consequence . But by being charged with emotion, the image gains numinosity (or psychic energy); it becomes dynamic , and consequences of some kind must flow from it. I am awar e tha t it is difficult to grasp this concept, because I am trying to use words to describe something whose very natur e makes it incapabl e of precise definition. But since so man y people have chosen to treat archetype s as if they were part of a mechanica l system tha t can be learned by rote, it is essential to insist tha t they are not mer e names, or even philosophical concepts. The y are pieces of life itself- images tha t are integrally connected to the living individua l by the bridge of the emotions. Tha t is why it is impossible to give an arbitrary (or universal) interpretation of any archetype . It must be explained in the manne r indicated by the whole life-situation of the particular individua l to whom it relates. Thus, in the case of a devout Christian, the symbol of the cross can be interpreted only in its Christian context — unless the dream produces a very strong reason to look beyond it. Even then, the specific Christian meanin g should be kept in mind. But one cannot say that, at all times and in all circumstances, the symbol of the cross has the same meaning. If tha t were so, it would be stripped of its numin - osity, lose its vitality, an d become a mer e word. Thos e wh o do not realize the special feeling tone of the archetype end with nothing mor e tha n a jumbl e of mythological concepts, which can be strung together to show tha t everything means anythin g — or nothing at all. All the corpses in the world are chemically identical, but living individuals are not. Archetype s come to life only whe n one patiently tries to discover why and in wha t fashion they are meaningful to a living individual. T h e mer e use of words is futile whe n you do not know wha t they stand for. This is particularly true in psychology, wher e we speak of arche - types such as the anima and animus, the wise 96 The ancient Chinese connecte d the moo n wit h the goddes s Kwan-Yi n (pictured above ) Other societies have personified the moo n as a divinity. An d thoug h moder n space flight has proved that the moo n is onl y a cratered ball of dirt (left), w e have retained somethin g of the archetypal attitude in our familiar association of the moo n wit h love a nd romance 97 In a child' s unconsciou s w e can see the powe r (and universality) of archetypal symbol s A seven-yearold' s painting (left) — a huge sun driving awa y black birds, demon s of the night—ha s the flavor of a true myt h Children at play (right) spontaneousl y dance in as natural a form of self-expression as the ceremonial dances of primitives. Ancien t folklore still exists in children's "ritual" beliefs: For instance, children all over Britain (and elsewhere) believe it is luck y to see a whit e horse—whic h is a well-know n symbo l of life A Celtic goddes s of creativity, Epona, show n (far right) riding a horse, wa s often personified as a whit e mare. man . the Grea t Mother, and so on. You can know all about the saints, sages, prophets, and other godly men, and all the great mothers of the world. But if they ar e mer e images whose numinosity you have never experienced, it will be as if you were talking in a dream, for you will not know wha t you are talking about. Th e mere words you use will be empt y and valueless. The y gain life an d meanin g only when you try to take into account their numinosity — i.e. their relationship to the living individual. Onl y then do you begin to understand that their names mean very little, whereas the way they are related to you is all-important. The symbol-producing function of our dreams is thus an attemp t to bring the original mind of ma n into "advanced' " or differentiated consciousness, wher e it has never been before and where , therefore, it has never been subjected to critical self-reflection. For, in ages long past, that original mind was the whole of man's personality. As he developed consciousness, so his conscious mind lost contac t with some of that primitive psychic energy. An d the conscious mind has never known that original mind ; for it was discarded in the process of evolving the very differentiated consciousness that alone could be awar e of it. Yet it seems that what we call the unconscious has preserved primitive characteristics that formed part of the original mind. It is to these characteristics that the symbols of dreams constantly refer, as if the unconscious sought to bring back all the old things from which the mind freed itself as it evolved illusions, fantasies, archai c thought forms, fundamenta l instincts, and so on. This is wha t explains the resistance, even fear, that people often experience in approach - ing unconscious matters. Thes e relict contents are not merely neutra l or indifferent. O n the contrary, they are so highly charged that they are often more than merely uncomfortable . They can cause real fear. The more they are repressed, the more they spread through the whole personality in the form of a neurosis. It is this psychic energy that gives them such vital importance . It is just as if a ma n who has lived through a period of unconsciousness should suddenly realize that there is a gap in his memor y — tha t importan t events seem to have taken place tha t he cannot remember. In so far as he assumes tha t the psyche is an exclusively personal affair (and this is the usual assumption), he will try to retrieve the apparently lost infantile memories. But the gaps in his childhood memor y are merely the symptoms of a much greate r loss the loss of the primitive psyche. As the evolution of the embryoni c body repeats its prehistory, so the mind also develops through a series of prehistoric stages. The main 98 task of dreams is to bring bark a sort bf "recollection" of the prehistoric, as well as the infantile world, right down to the level of the most primitive instincts. Such recollections can have a remarkably healing effect in certain cases, as Freud saw long ago. This observation confirms the view that an infantile memor y ga p (a socalled amnesia) represents a positive loss and its recovery can bring a positive increase in life and well-being. Because a child is physically small and its conscious thoughts are scarce and simple, we do not realize the far-reaching complications ol the infantile mind that are based on its original identity with the prehistoric psyche. Tha t "original mind " is just as muc h present and still functioning in the child as the evolutionary stages of mankind are in its embryoni c body. II the reader remembers what I said earlier about the remarkabl e dreams ol the child who made a present of her dreams to her father, he will get a good idea of wha t 1 mean. In infantile amnesia , one findsstrange mythological fragments that also often appea r in later psychoses. Images of this kind are highly numinous and therefore verv important. If such recollections reappea r in adult life, they may in some cases cause profound psychological disturbance, while in other people they can produce miracles of healing or religious conversions. Often they bring back a piece of life, missing for a long time, that gives purpose to and thus enriches huma n life. T h e recollection of infantile memories and the reproduction of archetypa l ways of psychic behavior can create a wider horizon and a greate r extension of consciousness on condition that one succeeds in assimilating and integrating in the conscious mind the lost and regained contents. Since they arc not neutral, their assimilation will modify the personality, just as they themselves will have to undergo certain alterations. In this part of wha t is called "th e individuation process " (which Dr. M.-L. von Franz describes in a later section of this book), the interpretation of svmbols plavs an importan t practical role. For the symbols are natura l attempts to reconcile and unite opposites within the psyche. Naturally, just seeing and then brushing aside the symbols would have no such effect and would merely re-establish the old neurotic condition and destroy the attemp t at a synthesis. Bttt. unfortunately, those rare people who do not deny the very existence of the archetypes almost invariably treat them as mere words and forget their living reality. Whe n their numino - sity has thus (illegitimately) been banished, the process of limitless substitution begins in other words, one glides easily from archetype to archetype , with everything meaning everything. It is true enough that the forms of arche - types are to a considerable extent exchangeable . But their numinosity is and remains a fact, and represents the value of an archetypa l event. This emotiona l value must be kept in mind and allowed for throughou t the whole intellectual process of dream interpretation. It is only too easy to lose this value, because thinking and feeling are so diametrically opposed that thinking almost automatically throws out feeling values and vice versa. Psychology is the only science that has to take the factor of value (i.e. feeling) into account, because it is the link between physical events and life. Psychology is often accused of not being scientific on this account; but its critics fail to understand the scientific and practical necessity of giving due consideration to feeling. 9<) IOO Healing the split Our intellect has created a new world tha t dominates nature , an d has populated it with monstrous machines. Th e latter are so indubitably useful tha t we canno t see even a possibility of getting rid of them or our subservience to them. Ma n is boun d to follow the adventurous promptings of his scientific an d inventive mind an d to admir e himself for his splendid achievements. At the same time, his genius shows the uncann y tendency to invent things that become mor e and mor e dangerous, because they represent better an d better means for wholesale suicide. In view of the rapidly increasing avalanche of world population, ma n has already begu n to seek ways an d means of keeping the rising flood at bay. But natur e ma y anticipat e all our attempts by turnin g against ma n his own creative mind. Th e H-bomb , for instance, would put an effective stop to overpopulation. In spite of our prou d dominatio n of nature , we are still her victims, for we have not even learned to control our own nature . Slowly but, it appears, inevitably, we are courting disaster. Ther e are no longer an y gods whom we can invoke to help us. Th e grea t religions of the world suffer from increasing anemia , because the helpful numin a have fled from the woods, rivers, an d mountains, an d from animals, and the god-men have disappeared undergroun d into the unconscious. Ther e we fool ourselves Above left, the 20t h century' s greatest city—Ne w York. Below , the end of another city—Hiroshima , 1945. Thoug h man may seem to have gained ascendance over nature, Jun g alway s pointed out that man has not yet gained control over his own nature. tha t they lead an ignominious existence amon g the relics of our past. Ou r present lives are dominate d by the goddess Reason, wh o is our greatest an d most tragic illusion. By the aid of reason, so we assure ourselves, we have "conquered nature. " But this is a mer e slogan, for the so-called conquest of natur e overwhelms us with the natura l fact of overpopulation an d adds to our troubles by our psychological incapacity to mak e the necessary political arrangements. It remains quit e natura l for men to quarre l an d to struggle for superiority over one another. H o w then have we "conquere d nature" ? As any change must begin somewhere , it is the single individua l wh o will experience it an d carry it through . Th e change must indeed begin with an individual; it might be an y one of us. Nobod y can afford to look aroun d an d to wait for somebody else to do wha t he is loath to d o himself. But since nobod y seems to know wha t to do, it might be worth while for each of us to ask himself whethe r by any chanc e his or her unconscious ma y know something tha t will help us. Certainly the conscious min d seems unabl e to do anythin g useful in this respect. M a n today is painfully awar e of the fact tha t neither his grea t religions nor his various philosophies seem to provide him with those powerful animatin g ideas tha t would give him the security he needs in face of the present condition of the world. I know wha t the Buddhists would say: Things would go right if people would only follow the "nobl e eightfold path " of the Dharma (doctrine, law) an d had true insight into the Self Th e Christian tells us tha t if only pcople had faith in God, we should have a better world. Th e rationalist insists tha t if people wer e intelligent and reasonable, all our problems would be manageable . Th e trouble is tha t none of them manage s to solve these problems himself I O I Christians often ask why God does not speak to them, as he is believed to have done in former days. Whe n I hea r such questions, it always makes me think of the rabbi wh o was asked how it could be tha t Go d often showed himself to people in the olden days wherea s nowadays nobody ever sees him. Th e rabbi replied: "Nowaday s there is no longer anybod y wh o can bow low enough. " This answer hits the nail on the head. We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness tha t we have forgotten the age-old fact tha t God speaks chiefly through dreams an d visions. Th e Buddhist discards the world of unconscious fantasies as useless illusions; the Christian puts his Churc h and his Bible between himself an d his unconscious; and the rationa l intellectual does not yet know that his consciousness is not his total psyche. This ignoranc e persists today in spite of the fact that for mor e than 70 years the unconscious has been a basic scientific concept tha t is indispensable to any serious psychological investigation. We can no longer afford to be so GodAlmighty-like as to set ourselves u p as judges of the merits or demerits of natura l phenomena . We do not base our botany upon the oldfashioned division into useful and useless plants, or our zoology upon the naive distinction between harmless an d dangerous animals. But we still complacently assume tha t consciousness is sense and the unconscious is nonsense. In science such an assumption would be laughed out of court. Do microbes, for instance, make sense or nonsense? Whateve r the unconscious ma y be, it is a natura l phenomeno n producing symbols that prove to be meaningful. We cannot expect someone who has never looked through a microscope to be an authority on microbes; in the same way, no one wh o has not mad e a serious study of natura l symbols can be considered a competent judg e in this matter. But the general undervaluation of the huma n soul is so great that neither the grea t religions nor the philosophies nor scientific rationalism have been willing to look at it twice. In spite of the fact that the Catholic Churc h admits the occurrenc e of somma a Deo missa (dreams sent by God), most of its thinkers mak e no serious attemp t to understan d dreams. I doub t whethe r ther e is a Protestant treatise or doctrine tha t would stoop so low as to admit the possibility tha t the vox Dei might be perceived in a dream. But if a theologian really believes in God , by wha t authority does he suggest that Go d is unabl e to speak through dreams ? I have spent mor e than half a century in investigating natura l symbols, and I have come to the conclusion tha t dreams and their symbols are not stupid and meaningless. O n the contrary, dreams provide the most interesting information for those who take the trouble to understan d their symbols. Th e results, it is true, have little to do with such worldly concerns as buying and selling. But the meanin g of life is not exhaustively explained by one's business life, nor is the deep desire of the huma n heart answered by a bank account. In a period of huma n history when all available energy is spent in the investigation of nature , very little attention is paid to the essence of man , which is his psyche, although man y researches are mad e into its conscious functions. But the really complex an d unfamiliar part of the mind, from which symbols are produced, is still virtually unexplored. It seems almost incredible tha t though we receive signals from it every night, deciphering these communications seems too tedious for an y but a very few people to be bothered with it. Man's greatest instrument, his psyche, is little thought of, and it is often directly mistrusted and despised. "It's only psychological " too often means: It is nothing. Where , exactly, does this immens e prejudice come from ? We have obviously been so busy with the question of wha t we think that we entirely forget to ask wha t the unconscious psyche thinks about us. Th e ideas of Sigmund Freud confirmed for most people the existing contempt for the psyche. Before him it had been merely overlooked and neglected; it has now become a dum p for moral refuse. 1 0 2 This modern standpoint is surely one-sided and unjust. It does not even accord with the known facts. Ou r actua l knowledge of the unconscious shows tha t it is a natura l phenomeno n and that, like Natur e herself, it is at least neutral. It contains all aspects of huma n natur e light and dark, beautiful and ugly, good and evil, profound and silly. Th e study of individual, as well as of collective, symbolism is an enormous task, and one that has not yet been mastered. But a beginning has been mad e at last. The early results are encouraging, an d they seem to indicate an answe r to man y so far unanswered questions of present-day mankind . Above, Rembrandt's Philosopher with an Open Book (1 633). The inward-looking old man provides an image of Jung' s belief that each of us must explore his ow n unconscious . The unconscious must not be ignored ; it is as natural, as limitless, and as powerful as the stars. i o 3 Ancient myths and modern man Joseph L. Henderson A ceremonial mask from the island of Ne w Ireland (Ne w Guinea) 2 Ancient myths and modern man The eternal symbols T h e ancient history of ma n is being meaning - fully rediscovered today in the symbolic images and myths that have survived ancient man . As archaeologists dig deep into the past, it is less the events of historical time that we learn to treasure than the statues, designs, temples, and languages that tell of old beliefs. Othe r symbols are revealed to us by the philologists and religious historians, wh o can translate these beliefs into intelligible moder n concepts. Thes e in turn are brought to life by the cultura l anthropolo - gists. The y can show tha t the same symbolic patterns can be found in the rituals or myths of small tribal societies still existing, unchange d for centuries, on the outskirts of civilization. All such researches have done muc h to correct the one-sided attitud e ol those moder n men who maintain that such symbols belong to the peoples of antiquity or to "backward" " modern tribes and ar e therefore irrelevant to the complexities of moder n life. In Londo n or New York we may dismiss the fertility rites of neolithic man as archai c superstition. If anyone claims to have seen a vision or heard voices, he is not treated as a saint or as an oracle. It is said he is mentally disturbed. We read the myths of the ancient Greeks or the folk stories of America n Indians, but we fail to see any connection between them and our attitudes to the "heroes " or dramati c events of today. Yet the connections are there. And the symbols that represent them have not lost their relevance for mankind . O n e of the main contributions of" our time to the understandin g an d revaluing of such eternal symbols has been mad e by Dr. Jung's School of Analytical Psychology. It has helped to break down the arbitrary distinction between primitive man . to whom symbols seem a natura l part of everyday life, and moder n man , for whom symbols are apparently meaningless and irrelevant. As Dr. Jun g has pointed out earlier in this book, the huma n mind has its own history and the psyche retains traces left from previous stages of its development. Mor e than this, the contents of the unconscious exert a formative influence on the psyche. Consciously we may ignore- them, hut unconsciously we respond to them, and to the symbolic forms including dreams—in which they express themselves. The individual may feel tha t his dreams ar e spontaneous and disconnected. But over a long period of time the analyst can observe a series of dream images and note that they have a meaningful pattern ; and by understandin g this his patient may eventually acquir e a new attitude to life. Some of the symbols in such dreams derive from wha t Dr. Jun g has called "the collective unconscious " tha t is, the part of the psyche tha t retains and transmits the common psychological inheritanc e of mankind . These symbols are so ancient an d unfamiliar to modern ma n tha t he cannot directly understand or assimilate them. It is here tha t the analyst can help. Possibly the patient must be freed from the encumbranc e of symbols that have grown stale and inappro - priate. Or possibly he must be assisted to discover the abiding value of an old symbol that, far from being dead, is seeking to be reborn in modern form. Before the analyst can effectively explore the meaning of symbols with a patient, he must himself acquire a wider knowledge of their origins and significance. For the analogies between ancient myths and the stories that appea r in the dreams of moder n patients are neither trivial nor accidental. The y exist because the unconscious mind of moder n ma n preserves the symbol-making capacity tha t once found expression in the beliefs an d rituals of the primitive. And tha t capacity still plays a role of vital psychic importance . In mor e ways than we realize, we are dependen t on the messages that are carried by such symbols, and both our attitudes and our behavior are profoundly influenced by them. In wartime , for instance, one finds increased interest in the works of Homer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoi, an d we read with a new understandin g those passages tha t give wa r its endurin g (or "archetypal" ) meaning. The y evoke a response from us tha t is muc h mor e profound than it could be from someone who has never known the intense emotiona l experience of war. Th e battles on the plains of Tro y were utterly unlike the fighting at Agincourt or Borodino, yet the great writers are able to transcend the differences of time and place and to express themes that are universal. We respond because these themes are fundamentally symbolic. A mor e striking exampl e should be familiar to anyone who has grown up in a Christian society. At Christma s we may express our inner feeling for the mythological birth of a semi- \ Far left, a symboli c ceremony of antiquit y in 20th-centur y form : The American astronaut Joh n Glenn in a Washingto n parade after his orbit of the earth in 1962 - like a hero of old, after a victory, returning hom e in a triumphal procession Center left, a cross-like sculpture of a Greek fertility goddes s (c 250 0 B.C.).

Un - knowingly, we have fallen in with the symbolism of rebirth. This is a relic of an immensely older solstice festival, which carries the hope tha t the fading winte r landscape of the northern hemispher e will be renewed. For all our sophistication we find satisfaction in this symbolic festival, just as we join with our children at Easter in the pleasant ritual of Easter eggs and Easter rabbits. But do we understan d wha t we do, or see the connection between the story of Christ's birth, death, an d resurrection an d the folk symbolism of Easter ? Usually we d o not even care to consider such things intellectually. Yet they complemen t each other. Christ's crucifixion on Good Friday seems at first sight to belong to the same patter n of fertility symbolism tha t one finds in the rituals of such othe r "saviors " as Osiris, Tammuz , and Orpheus. They , too, were of divine or semi-divine birth, they flourished, were killed, an d were reborn. The y belonged, in fact, to cyclic religions in which the deat h and rebirth of the god-king was an eternally recurring myth. But the resurrection of Christ on Easter Sund a y is muc h less satisfying from a ritual point of view than is the symbolism of the cyclic religions. For Christ ascends to sit at the right han d of Go d the Father: His resurrection occurs once an d for all. It is this finality of the Christian concept of the resurrection (the Christian idea of the Last Judgmen t has a similar "closed" theme ) that distinguishes Christianity from othe r god-king myths. It happene d once, an d the ritual merely commemorate s it. But this sense of finality is probabl y one reason why early Christians, still influenced by pre-Christian traditions, felt that Christianity needed to be supplemented by some elements of an older fertility ritual. The y needed the recurring promise of rebirth ; and tha t is wha t is symbolized by the egg and the rabbit of Easter. I have taken two quit e different examples to show how moder n ma n continue s to respond to profound psychic influences of a kind that, consciously, he dismisses as little mor e than the folk tales of superstitious and uneducated peoples. But it is necessary to go muc h further than this. Th e mor e closely one looks at the history of symbolism, and at the role that symLeft, a 13th-centur y Japanese scroll painting of the destruction of a city : below , similarly dominate d by flame and smoke, St. Paul's Cathedral, London , durin g an air raid in Worl d War II Method s of warfare have change d over the ages, but the emotional impac t of w a r is timeless and archetypal. bols have played in the life of man y different cultures, the mor e one understands tha t there is also a re-creative meanin g in these symbols. Some symbols relate to childhood and the transition to adolescence, others to maturity, and others again to the experience of old age, when ma n is preparin g for his inevitable death. Dr. Jun g has described how the dreams of a girl of eight contained the symbols one normally associates with old age. He r dreams presented aspects of initiation into life as belonging to the same archetypa l patter n as initiation into death. This progression of symbolic ideas ma y take place, therefore, within the unconscious mind of moder n ma n just as it took place in the rituals of ancient societies. This crucial link between archai c or primitive myths and the symbols produced by the unconscious is of immens e practical importanc e to the analyst. It enables him to identify and to interpre t these symbols in a context tha t gives them historical perspective as well as psychological meaning . I shall now take some of the mor e importan t myths of antiquity and show how — and to wha t purpos e — they are analogous to the symbolic material tha t we encounter in our dreams. Top left, Christ's nativity; center, his crucifixion ; bottom , his ascension. His birth, death, and rebirth follow s the pattern of many ancient hero myths— a pattern originally based on seasonal fertility rites like those probabl y held 300 0 years ago at England's Stoneheng e (seen belo w at daw n at the summer solstice). Heroes and hero makers T h e myth of the hero is the most commo n and the best-known myth in the world. We find it in the classical mythology of Greece an d Rome , in the Middl e Ages, in the Fa r East, and amon g contemporar y primitive tribes. It also appears in our dreams. It has an obvious dramati c appeal, and a less obvious, but nonetheless profound, psychological importance . Thes e hero myths vary enormously in detail, but the mor e closely one examine s them the more one sees that structurally they ar e very similar. They have , tha t is to say, a universal pattern, even though they were developed by groups or individuals without any direct cultural contac t with each other—by , for instance, tribes of Africans or North American Indians, or the Greeks, or the Incas of Peru. Ove r and over again one hears a tale describing a hero's miraculous but humbl e birth, his early proof of superhuma n strength, his rapid rise to prominence or power, his triumphan t struggle with the forces of evil, his fallibility to the sin of pride (kybris), an d his fall through betraya l or a "heroic " sacrifice tha t ends in his death . I shall later explain in mor e detail why I believe tha t this pattern has psychological meaning both for the individual, wh o is endeavoring to discover an d assert his personality, and for a whole society, which has an equa l need to establish its collective identity. But anothe r important characteristic of the hero myth provides a clue. In man y of these stories the early weakness of the hero is balanced by the appearanc e of strong "tutelary " figures or guardian s - who enabl e him to perform the superhuma n tasks that he cannot accomplish unaided. Amon g the Greek heroes, Theseus had Poseidon, god of the sea, as his deity; Perseus had Athena ; Achilles had Cheiron, the wise centaur, as his tutor. Thes e godlike figures are in fact symbolic representatives of the whole psyche, the larger The hero's early proof of strength occur s in most hero myth s Below , the infant Hercules killing tw o serpents.

Their special role suggests tha t the essential function of the heroic myt h is the development of the individual's ego-consciousness — his awareness of his own strengths and weaknesses—in a manne r tha t will equip him for the arduou s tasks with which life confronts him. Onc e the individual has passed his initial test an d can ente r the matur e phase of life, the hero myth loses its relevance. Th e hero's symbolic deat h becomes, as it were, the achievement of tha t maturity . I have so far been referring to the complet e hero myth, in which the whole cycle from birth to death is elaborately described. But it is essential to recognize that at each of the stages in this cycle there ar e special forms of the hero story that apply to the particula r point reached by the individual in the development of his egoconsciousness, and to the specific problem confronting him at a given moment. Tha t is to say, the image of the hero evolves in a manne r tha t reflects each stage of the evolution of the huma n personality. This concept can be mor e easily understood if I present it in wha t amounts to a diagram. I take this exampl e from the obscur e Nort h American tribe of Winnebag o Indians, because it sets out quit e clearly four distinct stages in the evolution of the hero. In these stories (which Dr. Paul Radi n published in 1948 unde r the title Hero Cycles of the Winnebago) we can see the definite progression from the most primitive to the most sophisticated concept of the hero. This progression is characteristic of other hero cycles. Thoug h the symbolic figures in them naturally have different names, their roles are similar, an d we shall understan d them better once we have grasped the point mad e by this example . Dr. Radi n noted four distinct cycles in the evolution of the hero myth. He name d them the Trickster cycle, the Hare cycle, the Red Horn cycle, an d the Twin cycle. He correctly perceived the psychology of this evolution when he said: "It represents our efforts to deal with the problem of growing up, aided by the illusion of an eternal fiction." T h e Trickster cycle corresponds to the earliest and least developed period of life. Trickster is a figure whose physical appetites dominat e his behavior; he has the mentality of an infant. Lacking any purpos e beyond the gratification of his primar y needs, he is cruel, cynical, and unfeeling. (Ou r stories of Brer Rabbit or Reynard the Fox preserve the essentials of the Trickster myth.) This figure, which at the outset assumes the form of an animal, passes from one mischievous exploit to another. But, as hedoes so, a chang e comes over him. At the end of his rogue's progress he is beginning to take on the physical likeness of a grown man . I I 2 The next figure is Hare . He also, like Trickster (whose anima l traits are represented among some America n Indians by a coyote), first appears in anima l form. He has not yet attained matur e huma n stature , but all the same he appears as the founder of huma n culture—the Transformer. Th e Winnebag o believe that, in giving them their famous Medicine Rite, he became their savior as well as their culture-hero. This myt h was so powerful, Dr. Radin tells us, tha t the members of the Peyote Rite were reluctant to give up Har e when Christianity began to penetrat e the tribe. He became merged with the figure of Christ, and some of them argued tha t they had no need of Christ since they already had Hare . This arche - typal figure represents a distinct advanc e on Trickster: On e can see tha t he is becoming a socialized being, correcting the instinctual and infantile urges found in the Trickster cycle. Red Horn , the third of this series of hero figures, is an ambiguou s person, said to be the youngest of 10 brothers. He meets the require - ments of an archetypa l hero by passing such tests as winning a race an d by proving himself in battle. His superhuma n powe r is shown by his ability to defeat giants by guile (in a game of dice) or by strength (in a wrestling match). He has a powerful companio n in the form of a thunderbird called "Storms-as-he-walks," whose strength compensate s for whateve r weakness Red Hor n may display. With Red Hor n we have reached the world of man , though an archai c world, in which the aid of superhuma n powers or tutelary gods is needed to ensure man's victory over the evil forces tha t beset him. Towar d the end of the story the hero-god departs, leaving Red Hor n and his sons on earth. T h e dange r to man's happiness an d security now comes from ma n himself. This basic theme (which is repeated in the last cycle, tha t of the Twins) raises, in effect, the vital question: How long can huma n beings, be successful without falling victims to their own pride or, in mythological terms, to the jealousy of the gods? Though the Twins are said to be the sons of the Sun, they are essentially huma n an d togethe r constitute a single person. Originally united in the mother's womb , they were forced apart at birth. Yet they belong together, and it is necessary — though exceedingly difficult— to reunit e them. In these two children we see the two sides of man's nature . On e of them. Flesh, is acquiescent, mild, and without initiative; the other, Stump , is dynami c an d rebellious. In some of the stories of the Twi n Heroes these attitudes arc refined to the point wher e one figure represents the introvert, whose main strength lies in his powers of reflection, and the other is an extravert, a ma n of action who can accomplish great deeds. "Trickster": the first, rudimentar y stage in the developmen t of the hero myth, in whic h the hero is instinctual, uninhibited , and often childish. Far left, the 16th-centur y Chinese epic hero Monkey , show n (in a modern Peking opera) tricking a river king into giving up a magi c staff. Left, on a sixth-centur y B.C. jar, the infant Hermes in his cradle after having stolen Apollo' s cattle. Right, the trouble-makin g Norse go d Loki (a 19th-centur y sculpture). Far right, Charlie Chaplin creating a disturbance in the 1936 film Modern Times—a 20th-century trickster. 1 1 3 For a long time these two heroes ar e invincible : Whethe r they ar e presented as two separat e figures or as two-in-one, they carry all before them. Yet, like the warrior gods of Navah o India n mythology, they eventually sicken from the abus e of their own power. Ther e ar e no monsters left in heaven or on earth for them to overcome , an d their consequent wild behavior brings retribution in its train. Th e Winnebag o say tha t nothing, in the end, was safe from them — not even the supports on which the world rests. Whe n the Twin s killed one of the four animals tha t upheld the earth, they had overstepped all limits, and the time had come to put a stop to their career. Th e punishment they deserved was death. Thus, in both the Red Hor n cycle an d that of the Twins, we see the theme of sacrifice or death of the hero as a necessary cur e for hybris, the pride tha t has over-reached itself. In the primitive societies whose levels of cultur e correspond to the Red Hor n cycle, it appears tha t this dange r may have been forestalled by the institution of propitiatory huma n sacrifice — a theme that has immens e symbolic importanc e and recurs continually in huma n history. Th e Winnebago , like the Iroquois and a few Algonquin tribes, probably ate huma n flesh as a totemic ritual tha t could tame their individualistic and destructive impulses. In the example s of the hero's betraya l or defeat tha t occur in Europea n mythology, the theme of ritual sacrifice is mor e specifically employed as a punishmen t for hybris. But the Winnebago , like the Navaho , d o not go so far. Thoug h the Twin s erred, and though the punishmen t should have been death, they themselves became so frightened by their irresponsible powe r that they consented to live in a state of permanen t rest: Th e conflicting sides of huma n natur e were again in equilibrium. I have given this description of the four types of hero at some , length because it provides a clear demonstration of the pattern tha t occurs both in the historic myths and in the hero dreams of contemporar y man . With this in mind we can examine the following dream of a middle-aged patient. The interpretation of this dream shows how the analytical psychologist can, from his knowledge of mythology, help his patient find an answe r to wha t might otherwise seem an insoluble riddle. This ma n dreame d hewas at a theatre , in the role of "a n important spectator whose opinion is respected. " Therewas an act in which a white monkey was standing on a pedestal with men aroun d him. In recounting his dream the ma n said : My guide explains the theme to me.' It is the ordeal of a voting sailor who is exposed both to The second stage in the evolutio n of the hero is the founder of huma n culture. Left, a Navah o sand paintin g of the myt h of Coyote, wh o stole fire from the god s and gave it to man. In Greek myt h Prometheus also stole fire from the god s for ma n — for whic h he wa s chained to a rock and tortured by an eagle (below , on a sixth-centur y B.c cup) . The hero in the third stage is a powerful man-go d — like Buddha . In the first-centur y sculpture above, Siddhartha begins the journey on whic h he wil l receive enlightenmen t and becom e Buddha . Belo w left, a medieval Italian sculpture of Romulu s and Remus , the twin s (raised by a wolf) wh o founde d Rome—an d wh o are the best-know n instance of the fourth stage of the hero myth . In the fourt h stage, the Twin s often misuse their power—a s di d the Roma n heroes Castor and Pollux whe n they abducte d the daughter s of Leucippus (below , in a painting by the Flemish artist Rubens). the wind and to being beaten up. I begin to object that this white monkey is not a sailor at all; but just at that moment a young man in black stands up and I think that he must be the true hero. But another handsome young man strides toward an altar and stretches himself out on it. They are making marks on his bare chest as a preparation to offering him as a human sacrifice. Then I find myself on a platform with several other people. We could get down by a small ladder, but I hesitate to do so because there are two young toughs standing by and I think that they will stop us. But when a woman in the group uses the ladder unmolested, I see that it is safe and all of us follow the woman down. Now a dream of this kind cannot be quickly or simply interpreted. We have to unrave l it carefully in orde r to show both its relation to the dreamer's own life an d its wider symbolic implications. Th e patient wh o produced it was a ma n wh o had achieved maturity in a physical sense. H e was successful in his career, an d he had apparentl y don e pretty well as a husban d and father. Yet psychologically he was still immature , an d had not completed his youthful phase of development. It was this psychic imma - turity tha t expressed itselfin his dreams as different aspects of the hero myth . Thes e images still exerted a strong attraction for his imagination even though they had long since exhausted any of their meanin g in terms of the reality of his everyday life. Thus, in a dream, we see a series of figures theatrically presented as various aspects of a figure tha t the dreame r keeps expecting will turn out to be the true hero. Th e first is a white monkey, the second a sailor, the third a young m a n in black, an d the last a "handsome young man. " In the early part of the performance , which is supposed to represent the sailor's ordeal, the dreame r sees only the white monkey. Th e ma n in black suddenly appears and as suddenly disappears; he is a new figure who first contrasts with the white monkey and is then for a momen t confused with the hero proper. (Such confusion in dreams is not unusual. Th e dreame r is not usually presented with clear images by the unconscious. He has to puzzle out a meanin g from a succession of contrasts and paradoxes.) Significantly, these figures appea r in the course of a theatrical performance , an d this context seems to be a direct reference by the dreame r to his own treatmen t by analysis: Th e "guide " he mentions is presumably his analyst. Yet he does not see himself as a patient who is being treated by a doctor but as "a n importan t spectator whose opinion is respected. " This is the vantag e point from which he sees certain figures whom he associates with the experience A n individual psyche develops (as does the hero myth ) from a primitive, childish stage—an d often images of the early stages can appear in the dreams of psychologicall y immature adults. The first stage migh t be represented by the carefree play of children — like the pillo w fight (far left) from the 1 93 3 French film Zero de Conduite. The secon d stage migh t be the reckless thrillseeking of early adolescence: Right, America n youth s test their nerves in a speeding car. A later stage can produc e idealism, and selfsacrifice in late adolescence, exemplified in the picture (opposite, far right) taken durin g the East Berlin rising (Jun e 1953 ) whe n youn g men fough t Russian tanks wit h stones. Ilf i of growing up. Th e white monkey, for instance, reminds him of the playful and somewha t lawless behavior of boys between the'ages of seven and 12. Th e sailor suggests the adventurousness of early adolescence, together with the consequent punishment by "beating " for irresponsible pranks. Th e dreame r could offer no association to the youn g ma n in black, but in the handsome young ma n abou t to be sacrificed he saw a reminde r of the self-sacrificing idealism of late adolescence. At this stage it is possible to put together the historical materia l (or archetypa l hero images) and the dat a from the dreamer's personal experience in orde r to see how they corroborate , contradict, or qualify each other. The first conclusion is tha t the white monkey seems to represent Trickster or at least those traits of personality tha t the Winnebag o attribute to Trickster. But, to me , the monkey also stands for something tha t the dreame r has not personally and adequatel y experienced for himself— he in fact says tha t in the dream he was a spectator. I found out tha t as a boy he had been excessively attache d to his parents, and that he was naturally introspective. For these reasons he had never fully developed the boisterous qualities natura l to late childhood ; nor had he joined in the game s of his schoolfellows. He had not, as the saying goes, "got up to monkey tricks " or practiced "monkeyshines. " Th e saying provides the clue here. Th e monkey in the dream is in fact a symbolic form of the Trickster figure. But why should Trickster appea r as a monkey? An d why should it be white ? As I have already pointed out, the Winnebag o myth tells us that, toward the end of the cycle, Trickster begins to emerge in the physical likeness of a man . And here, in the dream, is a monkey - so close to a huma n being tha t it is a laughabl e and not too dangerous caricatur e of a man . T h e dreame r himself could offer no personal association tha t could explain why the monkey was white. But from our knowledge of primitive symbolism we can conjecture that whiteness lends a special quality of "god-likeness " to this otherwise bana l figure. (Th e albino is regarded as sacred in man y primitive communities.) This fits in quit e well with Trickster's semi-divine or semi-magical powers. Thus, it seems, the white monkey symbolizes for the dreame r the positive quality of childhood playfulness, which he had insufficiently accepted at the time, an d which he now feels called upon to exalt. As the dream tells us, he places it "o n a pedestal, " wher e it becomes something mor e than a lost childhood experience. It is, for the adult man , a symbol of creative experimentalism. i '7 Next we come to the conclusion abou t the monkey. Is it a monkey, or is it a sailor wh o has to put u p with beatings ? Th e dreamer's own associations pointed to the meanin g of this transformation. But in any case the next stage in huma n development is one in which the irresponsibility of childhood gives way to a period of socialization, an d tha t involves submission to painful discipline. On e could say, therefore, tha t the sailor is an advance d form of Trickster, w h o is being changed into a socially responsibleperson by means of an initiation ordeal. Drawing on the history of symbolism, we can assumetha t the wind represents the natura l elements in this process, an d the beatings are those tha t are humanl y induced. At this point, then, we have a reference to the process tha t the Winnebag o describe in the Har e cycle, wher e the culture-hero is a weak yet struggling figure, ready to sacrifice childishness for the sake of further development. Onc e again, in this phase of the dream, the patient is acknowledging his failure to experience to the full an importan t aspect of childhood and early adolescence. He missed out on the playfulness of the child, an d also on the rathe r mor e advanced pranks of the young teenager, and he is seeking ways in which those lost experiences and personal qualities can be rehabilitated. Next comes a curious change in the dream. T h e young ma n in black appears, an d for a momen t the dreame r feels tha t this is the "tru e hero. " Tha t is all we ar e told abou t the ma n in black; yet this fleeting glimpse introduces a theme of profound importanc e —a theme that occurs frequently in dreams. This is the concept of the "shadow, " which plays such a vital role in analytical psychology. Dr. Jun g has pointed out tha t the shadow cast by the conscious mind of the individual contains the hidden, repressed, and unfavorable (or nefarious) aspects of the personality. But this darkness is not jusl the simple ((inverse of the conscious ego. Just as the ego contains unfavorable and destructive attitudes, so the shadow has good qualities— norma l instincts and creative impulses. Ego and shadow, indeed, although separate , are inextricably linked togethe r in muc h the same way tha t thought and feeling are related to each other. T h e ego, nevertheless, is in conflict with the shadow, in wha t Dr. Jun g once called "th e battle for deliverance. " In the struggle of primitive ma n to achieve consciousness, this conflict is expressed by the contest between the archetypa l hero and the cosmic powers of evil, personified by dragons and othe r monsters. In the developing consciousness of the individual the hero figure is the symbolic means by which the emerging ego overcomes the inertia of the unconscious mind, and liberates the matur e The young , undifferentiated ego - personality is protected by the mother— a protection imaged by the sheltering Madonna , left (in a painting by the 1 5th-centur y Italian artist Piero della Francesca), or by the Egyptian sky goddes s Nut, right, bendin g over the earth (in a fifth-centur y B.C. relief). But the ego must eventually free itself from unconsciousnes s and immaturity ; and its "battle for deliverance" is often symbolized by a hero's battle wit h a monster—lik e the Japanese g o d Susanoo' s battle wit h a serpent, t o p right (in a 19th-centur y print). The hero doesn't alway s wi n at once : For instance, Jona h wa s swallowe d by the whal e (far right, from a 14th-centur y manuscript). " 9 m a n from a regressive longing to return to the blissful state of infancy in a world dominate d by his mother. Usually, in mythology, the hero wins his battle against the monster. (I shall say mor e about this in a moment.) But there are othe r hero myths in which the hero gives in to the monster. A familiar type is tha t of Jona h and the whale , in which the hero is swallowed by a sea monster that carries him on a night sea journe y from west to east, thus symbolizing the supposed transit of the sun from sunset to dawn . The hero goes into darkness, which represents a kind of death . I have encountered this theme in dreams presented in my own clinical experience. The battle between the hero an d the dragon is the more active form of this myth, an d it shows mor e clearly the archetypa l theme of the ego's triump h over regressive trends. For most people the dar k or negative side of the personality remains unconscious. Th e hero, on the contrary, must realize that the shadow exists The ego's emergence can be symbolized not by a battle but by a sacrifice: death leading to rebirth. Revolution is sacrificial in this way : Delacroix's painting (below) , Greece expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi, personifies the countr y killed by civil w a r to be liberated and reborn. As individual sacrifices: the British poet Byron (above) died in Greece durin g the revolution (1824) . Belo w left, the Christian martyr St. Lucia sacrificed her eyes and her life for her religion. and that he can dra w strength from it. He must come to terms with its destructive power s if he is to becom e sufficiently terrible to overcome the dragon i.e. before the ego can triumph, it must maste r and assimilate the shadow. O n e can see this theme , incidentally, in a well-known literary hero figure (Jo e t he's character of Faust. In accepting the wage r o f Mephistopheles . Faus t put himself in the power of a "shadow"' figure that Goeth e describes as '"part of that power which, willing evil, finds the good."' Like the man whose dream I have been discussing, Faus t had failed to live out to the full an important part o f his early life. Hewas, accordingly, an unreal or incomplet e person who lost himself in a fruitless quest for metaphysical goal s that failed to materialize . He was still unwilling to accept life's challenge to live both the good and the bad. It is to this aspec t o f the unconscious that the young man in black in my patient' s drea m seems to refer. Such a reminde r o f the shadow side of his personality, of its powerful potential a nd its role in preparing the hero for the struggles o f life, is an essential transition from the earlier part s o f the dream to the theme of the sacrificial hero : the handsome young man who places himself on an altar. I his figure represents the form of heroism that is commonl y associated to the ego-building process o f late adolescence . A man expresses the ideal principles of his life at this time , sensing their powe r both to transform himself and to chang e his relations with others . H e is, so to speak, in the bloom of youth, attractive , full o f energy and idealism. Why . then, does he willingly offer himself as a huma n sacrifice? T h e reason, presumably, is the same as that which made the Twins of the Winnebag o myth give up their powe r on pain o f destruction. Th e idealism of youth, which drives one so hard, is bound to lead to over-confidence : Th e huma n ego can be exalted to experienc e godlike attributes , but only at the cost o f over-reaching itself a nd falling to disaster. (Thi s is the meaning o f the story of Icarus , the youth who is carried Below, a montag e of Worl d War I a call-to-arms poster, infantry, a military cemetery. Memorial s and religious services for soldiers wh o gave their lives for their countr y often reflect the cyclic "death and rebirth" theme of the archetypal heroic sacrifice. An inscription on one British memorial to the dead of World War I reads: "At the goin g dow n of the sun and in the mornin g we wil l remember them." In mythology , a hero's death is often due to his ow n hybris, whic h causes the god s to humbl e him. As a moder n example : In 1 91 2 the ship Titanic struck an iceberg and sank. (Right, a montag e of scenes of the sinking, from the 1 943 film Titanic.) Yet the Titanic had been called "unsinkable": according to the America n author Walter Lord, one sailor wa s heard to say, "Go d himself couldn' t sink this ship! " up to heaven on his fragile, humanl y contrived wings , but wh o flies too close to the sun and plunges to his doom.) All the same , the youthful ego mus t always run this risk, for if a young m a n does not strive for a highe r goal than he c an safely reach, he canno t surmount the ob - stacles between adolescenc e and maturity. S o far, I have been talking about the conclusions that, at the level o f his personal associations , my patient could draw from his own dream . Ye t ther e is an archetypa l level o f the dream — the mystery o f the proffered huma n sacrifice. It is precisely becaus e it is a mystery that it is expressed in a ritual ac t that, in its symbolism, carries us a long way bac k into man' s history. Here , as the ma n lies stretched out on an altar, we see a referenc e to an ac t even mor e primitive than those performed on the alta r stone in the templ e at Stonehenge . There , as on so man y primitive altars , we can imagine a yearly solstice rite combine d with the death and rebirth o f a mythologica l hero. T h e ritual has a sorrow about it that is also a kind of joy , an inward acknowledgment that death also leads to a new life. Whethe r it is expressed in the prose epi c o f the Winnebag o Indians , in a lamen t for the death o f Balde r in the Norse eddas , in Walt Whitman' s poems o f mourning for Abraha m Lincoln, or in the drea m ritual whereby a ma n returns to his I 2 2 Heroes often fight monster s t o rescue "damsel s In distress " (wh o symbolize the anima). Left, St, George slays a drago n to free a maiden (in a 1 5th-centur y Italian painting). Right, in the 1 916 film The Great Secret, the drago n has become a locomotiv e but the heroic rescue remains the same. youthful hopes and fears, it is the same theme — the dram a o f new birth through death. T h e end of the drea m brings out a curious epilogue in which the dreame r at last become s involved in the action o f the dream . H e and others ar e on a platform from which they have to descend. H e does not trust the ladde r becaus e of the possible interferenc e o f hoodlums , but a woman encourage s him to believe he can go down safely and this is accomplished. Sinc e I found out from his associations that the whol e performanc e he witnessed was part o f his analysis — a process o f inne r chang e that he was experiencing — he was presumabl y thinking o f the difficulty of getting bac k to everyday reality again. His fear o f the "toughs," as he calls them, suggests his fear that the Trickste r arche - type ma y appea r in a collective form. T h e saving element s in the dream are the man-made ladder, which here is probabl y a symbol o f the rational mind, and the presence of the woma n who encourage s the dreame r to use it. He r appearanc e in the final sequenc e of the dream points to a psychi c need to include a feminine principle as a complement to all this excessively masculine activity. It should not be assumed from wha t I have said, or from the fact that I have chosen to use the Winnebag o myth to illuminat e this particular dream , that one must seek for complet e and wholly mechanica l parallel s between a dream and the material s one can find in the history o f mythology. Eac h drea m is individual to the dreamer, and the precise form it takes is determined by his own situation. Wha t I have sought to show is the manne r in which the unconscious draws on this archetypa l materia l and modifies its patterns to the dreamer' s needs. Thus , in this particula r dream , one must not look for a direc t referenc e to what the Winne - bago describe in the Re d Horn or Twi n cycles ; the reference is rathe r to the essence o f those two themes—t o the sacrificial element in them. As a genera l rule it can be said that the need for hero symbol s arises when the ego needs strengthening when, that is to say, the conscious mind needs assistance in some task that it canno t accomplish unaided or without drawing on the sources o f strength that lie in the unconscious mind. In the dream I have been discussing, for instance , there was no reference to o ne o f the mor e important aspects o f the myth of the typical hero —hi s capacity to save or protec t beautiful women from terrible danger. (Th e damsel in distress was a favorite myth of medieval Europe.) Thi s is one way in which myths or dreams refer to the "anima " — the feminine element of the mal e psyche that Goeth e called "th e Eterna l Feminine." T h e natur e and function o f this femal e element will be discussed later in this book by Dr. von Franz . But its relation to the hero figure c an be illustrated here by a drea m produced by anothe r patient, also a ma n o f matur e years. H e began by saying : " I had returned from a long hike through India . A woma n had equipped myself and a friend for the journey, and on my return I reproached her for failing to give us black rainhats, telling her that through this oversight we had been soaked by the rain." Thi s introduction to the dream , it later emerged, referred to a period in this man' s youth when he was given to taking "heroic " walks through dangerous mountain country in compan y with a college friend. (As he had 123 neve r been to India , and in view o f his own associations to this dream , I concluded that the dream journey signified his exploration o f a new region —not, that is to say, a real plac e but the realm o f the unconscious.) In his drea m the patient seems to feel that a woma n — presumabl y a personification o f his anim a —ha s failed to prepar e him properly for this expedition. Th e lack o f a suitabl e rainha t suggests that he feels in an unprotected state o f mind, in which he is uncomfortabl y affected by exposur e to new and not altogethe r pleasant experiences . H e believes that the woma n should have provided a rainha t for him, just as his mothe r provided clothes for him to wea r as a boy. Thi s episode is reminiscent o f his early picaresque wanderings , when he was sustained by the assumption that his mothe r (the original feminine image ) would protec t him agains t all dangers . As he grew older, he saw that this was a childish illusion, and he now blame s his misfortune on his own anima , not his mother. In the next stage o f the dream the patient speaks o f participating in a hike with a group of people . H e grows tired and returns to an outdoor restaurant wher e he finds his raincoat, togethe r with the rainha t that he had missed earlier. H e sits down to rest; and, as he does so, he notices a poster stating that a local highschool boy is taking the part o f Perseus in a play. The n the boy in question appear s — who turns out to be not a boy at all but a husky young man . H e is dressed in gray with a black hat. and he sits down to talk with anothe r young man dressed in a black suit. Immediatel y after this scene the dreame r feels a new vigor, a nd finds that he is capabl e o f rejoining his party. The y all then climb over the next hill. There , below them, he sees their destination; it is a lovely harbo r town. H e feels both heartened a nd rejuvenated by the discovery. Here , in contras t to the restless, uncomfortable , and lonely journey of the first episode, the dreame r is with a group. Th e contras t marks a chang e from an earlier pattern of isolation and youthful protest to the socializing influence o f a relation to others . Sinc e this implies a new capacit y for relatedness , it suggests that his anim a must now be functioning better than it was before —symbolized by his discovery o f the missing hat that the anim a figure had previously failed to provide for him. But the dreame r is tired, and the scene at the restaurant reflects his need to look at his earlier attitude s in a new light, with the hope of renewing his strength by this regression. And so it turns out. Wha t he first sees is a poster suggesting the enactmen t o f a youthful hero role a high-school boy playing the part of Perseus. The n he sees the boy, now a man , with a friend who make s a sharp contras t to him. T h e one dressed in light gray, the othe r in black, can be recognized, from what I have previously said, as a version o f the Twins . The y are hero-figures expressing the opposites o f ego and alter-ego, which, however, appea r her e in a harmonious and unified relation. T h e patient' s associations confirmed this and emphasized that the figure in gray represent s a well-adapted, worldly attitude to life, whereas the figure in black represent s the spiritual life, in the sense that a clergyma n wear s black. Tha t they wore hats (and he now had found his own) points to their having achieved a relatively mature identity o f a kind that he had felt to be severely lacking in his own earlie r adolescent years, when the quality o f "Tricksterism " still clung to him, in spite o f his idealistic self-image as a seeker o f wisdom. His association to the Gree k hero Perseus was a curious one , which proved especially significant becaus e it revealed a glaring inaccuracy. It turned out that he thought Perseus was the hero who slew the Minotau r and rescued Ariadne from the Creta n labyrinth. As he wrot e the nam e down for me , he discovered his mistake—tha t it was Theseus , not Perseus , who slew the Minotau r —an d this mistake becam e suddenly meaningful, as such slips often do, by making him notic e wha t these two heroes had in common . The y both had to overcome their fear o f unconscious demoni c materna l powers and had to liberat e from these power s a single youthful feminine figure. Perseus had to cut off the head o f the gorgon Medusa, whose horrifying visage and snaky locks turned all who gazed upon them to stone. H e late r had to overcome the dragon that guarded Andromeda . Theseus represented the young patriarcha l spirit o f Athens who had to brave the terrors o f the Cretan labyrinth with its monstrous inmate , the Minotaur, which perhaps symbolized the unhealthy decadenc e o f matriarcha l Crete . (In all cultures , the labyrinth has the meanin g o f an entangling and confusing representation o f the world oi matriarcha l consciousness ; it can be traversed only by those who ar e ready for a special initiation into the mysterious world o f the collective unconscious.) Having overcome this danger, Theseus rescued Ariadne , a maiden in distress. This rescue symbolizes the liberation o f the anim a figure from the devouring aspec t o f the mothe r image . Not until this is accomplished c an a ma n achieve his first true capacit y for relatednes s to women . Th e fac t that this ma n had failed adequately to separat e the anim a from the mothe r was emphasized in anothe r dream , in which he encountered a dragon —a symboli c image for the "devouring " aspec t of his attachmen t to his mother. Thi s dragon pursued him, and becaus e he had no weapon .he began to get the worst o f the struggle. Significantly, however, his wife appeared in the dream , and he r appearanc e somehow made the dragon smalle r and less threatening. Thi s chang e in the drea m showed that in his marriage the dreame r was belatedly overcoming Some heroic battles and rescues from Greek myth : Far left, Perseus slays Medus a (on a sixth-centur y B.C. vase); left, Perseus wit h Andromeda (from a first-centur y B.C. mural) who m he saved from a monster. Right, Theseus kills the Minotau r (on a first-centur y B.C. jar) watche d by Ariadne; below , on a Cretan coin (67 B.C.), the Minotaur' s labyrinth. the attachmen t to his mother. In othe r words , he had to find a means o f freeing the psychi c energy attached to the mother-son relationship, in orde r to achieve a mor e adult relation to wome n — and , indeed, to adult society as a whole . Th e hero-dragon battl e was the symboli c expression o f this process o f "growin g up. " But the hero' s task has an aim that goes beyond biological and marita l adjustment. It is to liberat e the anim a as that inne r componen t of the psyche that is necessary for any true creative achievement. In this man' s case we have to guess the probability o f this outcom e becaus e it is not directly stated in the dream of the Indian journey. But I a m sure he would confirm my hypothesi s that his journey ove r the hill and the sight o f his goal as a peaceful harb o r town contained the rich promis e that he would discover his authenti c anim a function. H e would thus be cured o f his early resentment at not being given protection (the rainhat) by the woma n for his journey through India . (In dreams , significantly placed towns can often be anim a symbols.) T h e ma n had won this promis e o f security for himself by his contac t with the authenti c hero archetype , and had found a new co-opera - tive and related attitude to the group. His sense of rejuvenation naturally followed. H e had drawn on the inne r source o f strength that the hero archetype represents ; he had clarified and developed that part o f him which was symbolized by the woman ; and he had, by his ego's heroi c act, liberated himself from his mother. Thes e and man y othe r example s o f the hero myth in modern dreams show that the ego as hero is always essentially a beare r o f cultur e rathe r than a purely egocentri c exhibitionist. Even Trickster, in his misguided or unpurposive way, is a contributo r to the cosmos as primitive m an sees it. In Navah o mythology, as Coyote , he hurled the stars into the sky as an ac t of creation, he invented the necessary contingency o f death, and in the myth o f emergenc e he helped lead the peopl e through the hollow reed whereby they escaped from one world to anothe r abov e it wher e they wer e safe from the threat o f flood. W e have here a referenc e to that form o f creative evolution which evidently begins on a childlike , preconscious , or anima l level o f existence . Th e ego' s rise to effective conscious action become s plain in the true culture-hero. In the same fashion the childish or adolescent ego frees itself from the oppression o f parenta l expecta - tions and become s individual. As part o f this rise to consciousnes s the hero-dragon battl e ma y have to be fought and refought to liberate energy for the multitude o f huma n tasks that c an form a cultur e pattern out o f chaos . The hero's rescue of a maiden can symbolize the freeing of the anim a from the "devouring " aspect of the mother. This aspect is represented, far left, by Balinese dancers wearin g the mask of Rangda (left), a malign female spirit; or by the serpent that swallowe d and then regurgitated the Greek hero Jaso n (above). As in the dream discussed on p 124, a commo n anima symbol is a harbor tow n Below, a poster by Mar c Chagal l personifies Nice as a mermaid . Whe n this is successful, we see the full hero image emerging as a kind of ego strength for, if we are speaking in collective terms , a tribal identity) that has no further need to overcome the monster s and the giants . It has reached the point wher e these deep forces can be personalized. Th e "feminin e element" no longer ap - pears in dreams as a dragon, but as a woman ; similarly, the "shadow " side o f the personality takes on a less menacin g form. This important point is illustrated in the dream o f a man nearing 50 . All his life he had suffered from periodi c attacks o f anxiety associated with fear o f failure (originally engendered by a doubting mother). Ye t his actual achievements , both in his profession and in his personal relations , were well above average . In his dream his nine-year-old son appeared as a young man o f about 18 or 19, dressed in the shining armo r of a medieval knight. The young m an is called upon to fight a host o f men in black, which he prepares at first to do. Then he suddenly removes his helmet, and smiles at the leader of the menacin g host; it is clea r that they will not engage in the battl e but will become friends. The son in the dream is the man' s own youthful ego, which had frequently felt threatened by the shadow in the form o f self-doubt. He had, in a sense, waged a successful crusade agains t this adversary all his matur e life. Now, partly through the actual encouragement of seeing his son grow up without such doubts , but mainly by forming a suitable image o f the hero in the form closest to his own environmenta l pattern, he finds it no longer necessary to fight the shadow ; he can accept it. Tha t is what is symbolized in the ac t o f friendship. He is no longer driven to a competitive struggle for individual supremacy, but is assimilated to the cultural task o f forming a democrati c sort o f com - munity. Such a conclusion, reached in the fullness of life, goes beyond the heroi c task and leads one to a truly matur e attitude . This change , however, does not take place automatically. It requires a period of transition, which is expressed in the various forms o f the archetype of initiation. i 28 The archetype of initiation In a psychological sense the hero imag e is not to be regarded as identical with the ego proper. It is bette r described as the symboli c means by which the ego separates itself from the arche - types evoked by the parenta l images in early childhood. Dr. Jun g has suggested that each huma n being has originally a feeling o f whole - ness, a powerful and complet e sense o f the Self. A nd from the Self the totality o f the psyche — the individualized ego-consciousnes s emerges as the individual grows up. Within the past few years, the works of certain followers of Jun g have begun to document the series o f events by which the individual ego emerge s during the transition from infancy through childhood. This separation can never becom e final without severe injury to Unoriginal sense o f wholeness . And the ego must continually return to re-establish its relation to 128 the Self in orde r to maintain a condition o f psychic health. It would appea r from my studies that the hero myth is the first stage in the differentiation of the psyche. I have suggested that it seems to go through a fourfold cycl e by which the ego seeks to achieve its relative autonom y from the original condition o f wholeness . Unles s some degre e o f autonom y is achieved, the individual is unabl e to relate himself to his adult environment. But the hero myth does not ensure that this liberation will occur. It only shows how it is possible for it to occur, so that the ego ma y achieve consciousness . Ther e remains the problem o f maintaining and developing that consciousnes s in a meaningful way, so that the individual can live a useful life and can achieve the necessary sense o f self-distinction in society. Ancient history and the rituals o f contem - porary primitive societies have provided us with a wealth o f materia l about myths and rites o f initiation, whereb y young men and women ar e weaned awa y from their parent s and forcibly made member s o f their clan or tribe. But in makin g this break with the childhood world, the original parent archetype will be injured, a nd the damag e must be made good by a healing process o f assimilation into the life o f the group. (Th e identity o f the group and the individual is often symbolized by a totem animal.) Thu s the group fulfills the claims o f the injured archetv pe and become s a kind ol second parent to which the young ar e first symbolically sacrificed, only to re-emerge into a new life. In this "drasti c ceremony , which looks very like a sacrifice to the power s that might hold the young ma n back," as Dr. Jun g has put it, A primitive tribe's totem (often an animal) symbolizes each tribesman' s identity wit h the tribal unit. Left, an Australian aborigine imitating (in a ritual dance ) his tribe's tote m — a n emu. Man y moder n group s use totem-like animals as emblems : Below, a heraldic lion (from the Belgian coat of arms) on a 17th - century allegorical map of Belgium . Right, the falcon is the mascot of the American Air Force Academy' s football team. Far right, moder n totemistic emblem s that aren't animals: a shop windo w display of ties, badges, etc. of British schools and clubs. I 2 9 wc sec how the powe r o f the original archetype can never be permanentl y overcome , in the manne r envisaged by the hero-dragon battle , without a crippling sense ol alienation from the fruitful power s o f the unconscious . W e saw in the myth o f the Twins how their hybris, expressing excessive ego-Self separation, was corrected by their own fear o f the consequences , which forced them back into a harmonious egoSelf relation. In tribal societies it is the initiation rite that most effectively solves this problem. Th e ritual takes the novice back to the deepesl level ol original mother-child identity or ego-Self identity, thus forcing him to experienc e a symboli c death. In othe r words , his identity is temporarily dismembered o r dissolved in the collective unconscious . From this state he is then ceremonially rescued by the rite ol the new birth. This is the first act o f true consolidation ol the ego with the larger group, expressed as totem, clan, or tribe, or all three combined. T h e ritual, whethe r it is found in tribal groups or in mor e comple x societies, invariably insists upon this rite o f death and rebirth, which provides the novice with a "rit e o f passage " from one stage o f life to the next, whethe r it is from early childhood to later childhood or from early to late adolescenc e and from then to maturity. Initiatory events ar e not, o f course, confined to the psychology of youth. Every new phase o f development throughout an individual' s life is accompanied by a repetition of the original conflict between the claims o f the Sell and the claims ol the ego. In fact, this conflict may be expressed mor e powerfully at the period of transition from early maturity to middle age (between 3 5 and 4 0 in our society than at any other time in life. And the transition from middle age to old age create s again the need for affirmation of the differenc e between the ego and the total psyche ; the hero receives his last call to action in defense o f ego-conscious - ness against the approachin g dissolution o f life in death. At these crucial periods , the archetype o f initiation is strongly activated to provide a meaningful transition that offers something more spiritually satisfying than the adolescent rites with their strong secular flavor. The arche - typal patterns ol initiation in this religious sense known since ancient times as "th e mysteries " are woven into the textur e o f all ecclesiastical rituals requiring a special manne r o f worship at the time o f birth, marriage , or death. As in our study o f the hero myth, so in the study of initiation we must look for example s in the subjective experience s o f modern people and especially o f those who have undergone analysis . It is not surprising that there should appear, in the unconscious of someone who is seeking help from a doctor specializing in psychic disorders , images that duplicat e the majo r patterns o f initiation as we know them from history. Perhaps the commones t ol these theme s to be found in young people is the ordeal, or trial of strength. Thi s might seem to be identical with what we have already noticed in modern dreams illustrating the hero myth, such as the sailor who had to submit to the weathe r and to beatings , or that proof o f fitness represented in the hike through Indi a o f the ma n without a rainhat. W e can also sec this theme o f physical suffering carried to its logical end in the first dream I discussed, when the handsome young m an becam e a huma n sacrifice on an altar. This sacrifice resembled the approach to initiation, but its end was obscured. It seemed to round off the hero cycle , to make way lor a new theme . Ther e is one striking difference between the hero myth and the initiation rite. Th e typical hero figures exhaus t their efforts in achieving the goal of their ambitions ; in short, they become successful even if immediately afterward thev are punished or killed for their hybris. In contras t to this, the novice for initiation is called upon to give up willful ambition Primitive initiation rituals bring the youth into adulthoo d and into the tribe's collective identity. In many primitive societies, initiation is accomplished by circumcision (a symbolic sacrifice). Here are four stages in a circumcision rite of Australian aborigines. Far left.top and center: The boy s are placed under blankets (a symboli c death from whic h they wil l be reborn). Bottom, they are removed and held by the men for the actual operation. Left, the circumcised boys are given men's conical caps, a mark of their new status. Right, they are finally isolated from the tribe to be purified and given instruction. ' 3 1 and all desire and to submit to the ordeal. He must be willing to experience this trial without hope of success. In fact, he must be prepared to die; and though the token of his ordeal may be mild (a period of fasting, the knocking out of a tooth, or tattooing) or agonizing (the infliction of the wounds of circumcision, subincision, or other mutilations), the purpose remains always the same: To create the symbolic mood of death from which may spring the symbolic mood of rebirth. A young man of 25 dreams of climbing a mountain on top of which there is a kind of altar. Near the altar he sees a sarcophagus with a statue of himself upon it. Then a veiled priest approaches carrying a staff on which there glows a living sun-disk. (Discussing the dream later, the young man said that climbing a mountain reminded him of the effort he was making in his analysis to achieve self-mastery.) To his surprise, he finds himself, as it were, dead, and instead of a sense of achievement he feels deprivation and fear. Then comes a feeling of strength and rejuvenation as he is bathed in the warm rays of the sun-disk. This dream shows quite succinctly the distinction we must make between initiation and the hero myth. The act of climbing the mountain seems to suggest a trial of strength: It is the will to achieve ego-consciousness in the heroic phase of adolescent development. The patient had evidently thought that his approach to therapy would be like his approach to other tests of manhood, which he had approached in the competitive manner characteristic of young men in our society. But the scene by the altar corrected this mistaken assumption, showing him that his task is rather to submit to a power greater than himself. He must see himself as if he were dead and entombed in a symbolic form (the sarcophagus) that recalls the archetypal mother as the original container of all life. Only by such an act of submission can he experience rebirth. An invigorating ritual brings him to life again as the symbolic son of a Sun Father. Here again we might confuse this with a hero cycle — that of the Twins, the "children of the Sun." But in this case we have no indication that the initiate will over-reach himself. Instead, he has learned a lesson in humility by experiencing a rite of death and rebirth that marks his passage from youth to maturity. According to his chronological age he should already have made this transition, but a prolonged period of arrested development has held him back. This delay had plunged him into a neurosis for which he had come for treatment, and the dream offers him the same wise counsel that he could have been given by any good tribal medicine man — that he should give up scaling mountains to prove his strength and submit to the meaningful ritual of an initiatory change that could fit him for the new moral responsibilities of manhood. The theme of submission as an essential attitude toward promotion of the successful initiation rite can be clearly seen in the case of girls or women. Their rite of passage initially emphasizes their essential passivity, and this is reinforced by the psychological limitation on theirautonomyimposedby the menstrual cycle. It has been suggested that the menstrual cycle may actually be the major part of initiation from a woman's point of view, since it has the power to awaken the deepest sense of obedience to life's creative power over her. Thus she willingly gives herself to her womanly function, much as a man gives himself to his assigned role in the community life of his group. On the other hand, the woman, no less than the man, has her initial trials of strength that A sarcophagus from second-centur y A . D .

In 11 is dream he was engaged in a ritual dance along with anothe r ma n and two othe r women, one of whom was his fiancee. Th e others were an older ma n and wife, who impressed thedreamerbecau.se . despite their closenes s to each other, they seemed to have room for their individual differences , and did nol appear to be possessive. Thes e two therefore represented to this young man a married statethat did not impose undue constraint on the development o f the individual natur e of the two partners. If it were possible for him to achieve this condition, marriag e would then becom e acceptable to him. In the ritual danc e each ma n faced his woman partner, and all four took their places at the corner s o f a squar e dancing ground. As they danced, it becam e apparent that this was also a kind o f sword dance . Each dance r had in his hand a short sword with which to perform a difficult arabesque , moving arms and legs in a series o f movement s that suggested alternate impulses ol aggression and submission to each other. In the final scene o f the danc e all four dancer s had to plunge- the swords into their own breasts and die. Onl y the dreame r refused to accomplish the final suicide, and was left standing alone after the other s had fallen. He felt deeply ashamed o f his cowardly failure to sacrifice himself with the others . This dream brought home to my patient the fact that he was mor e than ready to chang e his attitude to life. H e had been self-centered, seeking the illusory safety o f personal independenc e but inwardly dominated by the fears caused by childhood subjection to his mother. He needed a challenge to his manhood in order to see that unless he sacrificed his childish state o f mind he would be left isolated and ashamed. T h e dream, and his subsequent insight into its meaning , dispelled his doubts . He had passed through the symboli c rite by which a young m an gives up his exclusive autonom y and accept s his shared life in a related, not jus t heroic , form. A nd so he married and found appropriat e fulfillment in his relationship with his wife. Fa r from impairing his effectiveness in the world, his marriage actually enhanced it. Quit e apart from the neuroti c fear that invisible mother s or lather s may be lurking behind the marriage veil, even the norma l voting man has good reason to leel apprehensive about the wedding ritual. It is essentially a woman' s initiation rite, in which a man is bound to feel like anything but a conquering hero. No wonde r we find, in tribal societies, such counterphobi c rituals as the abduction or ' 3 5 rape o f the bride . Thes e enabl e the ma n to cling to the remnant s o f his heroi c role at the very momen t that he mus t submit to his bride and assume the responsibilities o f marriage . But the theme o f marriag e is an imag e o f such universality that it also has a deepe r mean - ing. It is an acceptable , even necessary, symbolic discovery o f the feminine componen t o f a man' s own psyche , jus t as muc h as it is the acquisition o f a real wife. S o one ma y encounter this archetype in a ma n o f any age in response to a suitabl e stimulus . N ot all women , however, reac t trustingly to the married state . A woma n patient who had unfulfilled longings for a career, which she had h ad to give up for a very difficult and shortlived marriage , dreamed that she was kneeling opposite a ma n who was also kneeling. H e had a ring that he prepared to put on he r finger, but she stretched out he r right-hand ring finger in a tense manner—evidentl y resisting this ritual of marita l union. It was easy to point out he r significant error. Instead o f offering the left-hand ring finger (by which she could accept a balanced and natura l relation to the masculine principle ) she had wrongly assumed that she had to put her entire conscious (i.e. right-sided) identity in the service o f the man . In fact, marriag e required her to shar e with him only that subliminal, natura l (i.e. left-sided) part of herself in which the principl e o f union would have a symbolic , not a literal or absolute , meaning . He r fear was the fear o f the woma n who dreads to lose he r identity in a strongly patriarcha l marriage , which this woma n had good reason to resist. Nevertheless , the sacred marriag e as an archetypa l form has a particularly important meanin g for the psychology o f women , and one for which they ar e prepared during their ado - lescenc e by man y preliminary event s o f an initiatory character. The archetypal sacred marriage (the union of opposites , of the male and female principles) represented here by a 19th-centur y Indian sculpture of the deities Siva and Parvati. Beauty and the Beast Girls in our society shar e in the masculine hero myths because , like boys , they mus t also develop a reliabl e ego-identity and acquir e an education. But ther e is an olde r laye r o f the mind that seems to com e to the surface in their feelings, with the aim o f makin g them into women, not into imitation men. Whe n this ancient content o f the psyche begins to mak e its appearance , the moder n young woma n ma y repress it becaus e it threatens to cut he r off from the emancipated equality o f friendship and opportunity to compet e with men that have become he r modern privileges. Thi s repression ma y be so successful that for a time she will maintain an identification with the masculine intellectual goals she learned at school or college. Eve n when she marries , she will preserve some illusion o f freedom, despite her ostensible ac t o f submission to the archetype of marriage—wit h its implicit injunction to become a mother. An d so there ma y occur, as we very frequently see today, tha t conflic t which in the end forces the woma n to rediscover her buried womanhoo d in a painful (but ultimately rewarding) manner. I saw an exampl e o f this in a young married woman who did not yet have any children but who intended to have one or two eventually, because it would be expected o f her. Mean - while her sexual response was unsatisfactory. This worried her and he r husband, though they were unabl e to offer any explanation for it. She had graduated with honor s from a good women's college and enjoyed a life o f intellec - tual companionship with he r husband and othe r men. Although this side o f he r life went well enough muc h o f the time , she had occasional outbursts of tempe r and talked in an aggressive fashion that alienated men and gave he r an intolerable feeling o f dissatisfaction with herself. She had a drea m at this time that seemed so important she sought professional advic e to understand it. She dreamed she was in a line o f young wome n like herself, and as she looked ahead to wher e they wer e going she saw that as each cam e to the head o f the line she was de - capitated by a guillotine. Withou t any fear the dreame r remained in the line, presumabl y quit e willing to submit to the same treatment when h e r turn came . I explained to he r tha t this mean t she was ready to give up the habit o f "living in he r head" ; she mus t learn to free he r body to discove r its natura l sexual response and the fulfillmen t o f its biological role in motherhood. Th e dream expressed this as the need to mak e a drasti c change ; she had to sacrifice the "mascu - line " hero role. As one might expect, this educated woma n h ad no difficulty in accepting this interpretation at an intellectual level, and she set about trying to chang e herself into a mor e submissive kind o f woman . Sh e did then improve he r love-life a nd becam e the mothe r of two very satisfactory children. As she grew to know herself better, she began to sec that for a ma n (or the masculine-trained mind in women) life is something that has to be taken by storm, as an ac t of the heroi c will; but for a woma n to feel right about herself, life is best realized by a process of awakening. A universal myth expressing this kind o f awakening is found in the fairy tale o f Beaut y a nd the Beast. Th e best-known version o f this story relates how Beauty , the younges t of four daughters , become s he r father'sfavorit e becaus e o f her unselfish goodness . Whe n she asks he r fathe r only for a whit e rose, instead o f the mor e costly present s demande d by the others , she is awar e only of he r inne r sincerity o f feeling. She does not know that she is about to endange r her father' s life and he r ideal relation with him. F o r he steals the whit e rose from the enchanted garden o f Beast, who is stirred to ange r by the theft and requires him to return in three months for his punishment, presumabl y death. 137 (In allowing the lathe r this reprieve to go home with his gilt. Beast behave s out o f character, especially when he also oilers to send him a trunk full o f gold when he gets home . As Beauty' s fathe r comments , the Beast seems cruel and kind at the same time.) Beauty insists upon taking her father' s punishment and returns after three months to the enchanted castle. There she is given a beautiful room wher e she has no worries and nothing to fear except the occasional visits o f Beast, who repeatedly come s to ask her if she will someday marry him. She always refuses. Then, seeing in a magi c mirror a pictur e o f her father lying ill. she begs Beast to allow her to return to comfort him, promising to return in a week. Beast tells her that he will die if she deserts him. but she m a y go for a week. At home , her radiant presence brings joy to her lather and envy to her sisters, who plot to detain her longer than her promised stay. At length she dreams that Beast is dying o f despair. S o. realizing she has overstayed her time , she returns to resuscitate him. Quit e forgetting the dying Beast' s ugliness. Beauty ministers to him. He tells her that_hc was unabl e to live without her. and that he will die happy now that she has returned. But Beauty realizes that she cannot live without Beast, that she has fallen in love with him. She tells him so. and promises to be his wile if only he will noi die. At this the castle is Idled with a blaze of light and the sound of music , and Beast disappears . In his plac e stands a handsome prince , who tells Beauty that he had been enchanted by a witch and turned into the Beast. The spell was ordained to last until a beautiful girl should love Beast for his goodness alone . In this story, if we unravel the symbolism, we are likely to see that Beauty is any young girl or woma n who has entered into an emotiona l bond with her lather, no less binding becaus e o f its spiritual nature . He r goodness is symbolized by her request lor a white rose, but in a significant twist o f meaning her unconscious intention puts her lathe r and then herself in the powe r o f a principle that expresses not goodnes s alone , but cruelty and kindness com - bined. It is as if she wished to be rescued from a love holding her to an exclusively virtuous a nd unreal attitude . Bv learning to love Beast she awakens to the power of huma n love concealed in its anima l and therefore imperfec t but genuinely erotic form. Presumably this represents an awakening of her true function o f relatcdncss , enabling her to accept the eroti c component o f her original wish, which had to be repressed becaus e ol a fear of incest. To leave her father she had. as it were, lo accept the inccsl-lear. to allow herself to live in its presence in fantasy until she could get to know the anima l man and discover her own true response to it as a woman . Three scenes from the 1 946 film of Beauty and the Beast (directed by France's Jean Cocteau): Left, Beauty's father caugh t stealing the whit e rose from the Beast's garden ; right, the Beast dying ; far right, the Beast transformed into a Prince, walkin g wit h Beauty. The story can be said to symbolize a youn g girl's initiation — i.e. her release fro m her bon d wit h the father, in order to com e to terms wit h the erotic animal side of her nature. Unti l this is done, she canno t achieve a true relationship wit h a man . In ihis way she redeems herself and her image ol the masculine from the forces o f repression, bringing to consciousnes s her capacity to trust her love as something that combine s spirit and natur e in the best sense o f the words. A dream <>l an emancipated woma n patient ol mine represented this need to remove the incest-fear, a very real fear in this patient' s thoughts, becaus e ol her father' s over-close attachment to her following his wife's death. I he dream showed her being chased In a furious bull. She lied at first, but realized it was no use. She fell and the bull was upon her. She knew her only hope was to sing to the bull, and when she did. though in a quavering voice, the hull calmed down and began licking her hand with its tongue . Th e interpretation showed that she could now learn to relate to men in a mor e confidently feminine way not only sexually, hut erotically in the wider sense o f relatednes s on the level ol her conscious identity. But in the cases o f olde r women , the Beasi theme may not indicat e the need to find the answer to a personal fixation or to release a sexual inhibition, or any of the things that the psychoanalytically minded rationalis t may see in the myth. It can be . in fact, (he expres - sion ol a certain kind o f woman' s initiation, which may be just as meaningful al the onset of the menopaus e as at the height o f adoles - cence ; and it may appea l at any age . when the union ol spirit and natur e has been disturbed. A woman of menopausa l age reported the following dream : I am with several anonymous women whom I don't seem to know. We go downstairs in a strange house, and are confronted suddenly by some grotesque "ape-men' ' with evil laces dressed in fur with trray and black rings, with tails, horrible and leering. We arc completely in their power, but suddenly I feel the only way we can save ourselves is not to panic and run or fight, but to treat these creatures with humanity as il to make them aware of their better side. So one ol the ape-men comes up to me and I greet him like a dancing partner and begin to dance with him. Later. I have been given supernatural healing powers and there is a man who is at death's door. I have a kind of quill or perhaps a bird's beak through which I blow air into his nostrils and he begins to breathe again. During the years o f her marriage and the raising of her children, this woman bad been obliged to neglect her creative gill, with which she had onc e made a small but genuine reputation as a writer. At the lime of her dream she bad been trying to force herself back to work again, at the same time criticizing hersell unmercifully lor not being a bette r wife, friend, and mother. Th e dream showed her problem in the light of othe r women who might be going through a similar transition, descending, as the dream puts il. into the lower regions ol a strange bouse from a too highly conscious level. Thi s we can guess to be the entranc e to some meaningful aspec t o f the collective unconscious , with its challenge to accept the masculine principle as animal-man , that same heroic , clownlike Trickste r figure we me t at the beginning of the primitive hero cycles . F o r he r to relat e to this ape-man , and humaniz e him by bringing out what is good in him, mean t that she would first have to accept some unpredictabl e element o f he r natura l creative spirit. Wit h this she could cut across the conventiona l bonds o f he r life and learn to write in a new way, mor e appropriat e for he r in the second part o f life. Tha t this impuls e is related to the creative masculine principl e is shown in the second scene wher e she resuscitates a ma n by blowing air through a kind o f bird' s beak into his nose. Thi s pneumati c procedur e suggests the need for a revival o f the spirit rathe r than the principl e o f eroti c warmth . It is a symbolism known all over the world: Th e ritual act brings the creative breath o f life to any new achievement. T h e dream o f anothe r woma n emphasize s the "nature " aspec t o f Beaut y and the Beast: Something flies or is thrown in through the window, like a large insect with whirling spiral legs, yellow and black. It then becomes a queer animal, striped yellow and black, like a tiger, with bear-like, almost human paws and a pointed wolflike face. It may run loose and harm children. It is Sunday afternoon, and I see a little girl all dressed in white on her way to Sunday school. I must get the police to help. But then I see the creature has become part woman, part animal. It fawns upon me, wants to be loved. I feel it's a fairy-tale situation, or a dream, and only kindness can transform it. I try to embrace it warmly, but I can't go through with it. I push it away. But I have the feeling I must keep it near and get used to it and maybe someday I'll be able to kiss it. Her e we have a different situation from the previous one. Thi s woma n had been too intensively carried awa y by the masculine creative function within herself, which had becom e a compulsive , menta l (that is, "air-borne") pre - occupation. Thu s she has been prevented from discharging he r feminine , wifely function in a natura l way. (In association to this dream she said: "Whe n my husband come s home , my creative side goes underground and I become the over-organized housewife.") He r dream takes this unexpected turn o f transforming her spirit gone bad into the woma n she must accept a nd cultivat e in herself; in this way she can harmoniz e he r creative intellectual interests with the instincts that enabl e he r to relate warml y to others . Thi s involves a new acceptanc e o f the dual principl e o f life in nature , o f that which is cruel but kind, or, as we might say in he r case, ruthlessly adventurous but at the same time humbl y a nd creatively domestic . Thes e opposites obviously canno t be reconciled except on a highly sophisticated psychological level o f awareness , a nd would o f course be harmful to that innocent child in her Sunday-school dress. T h e interpretation one could plac e on this woman' s drea m is that she needed to overcome some excessively naive imag e o f herself. Sh e had to be willing to embrac e the full polarity o f her feelings — just as Beauty had to give up the innocenc e o f trusting in a fathe r who could not give he r the pur e whit e rose o f his feeling without awakening the beneficent fury o f the Beast. Above , the Greek go d Dionysu s ecstatically playing the lute (in a vase painting). The frenzied an d orgiastic rites of the Dionysiac cults symbolized initiation into nature's mysteries. Right, Maenad s worshipin g Dionysus ; far right, satyrs in the same wil d worship . 140 Orpheus and the Son of Man "Beaut y and the Beast" is a fairy tale with the quality o f a wild flower, appearing so unexpectedly and creating in us such a natura l sense o f wonder that we do not notic e for the momen t that it belongs to a definite class, genus , and species o f plant. Th e kind o f mystery inherent in such a story is given a universal application not only in a large r historical myth, but also in the rituals whereby the myth is expressed or from which it ma y be derived. T h e type o f ritual and myth appropriately expressing this type o f psychological experienc e is exemplified in the Greco-Roma n religion o f Dionysus, and in its successor, the religion o f Orpheus . Both o f these religions provided a significant initiation o f the type known as "mys - teries." The y brought forth symbol s associated with a god-ma n o f androgynous characte r who was supposed to have an intimat e understanding of the anima l or plant world and to be the maste r o f initiation into their secrets . T h e Dionysia c religion contained orgiastic rites that implied the need for an initiate to abando n himself to his anima l natur e and thereby experienc e the full fertilizing powe r o f the Eart h Mother. Th e initiating agent for this rite o f passage in the Dionysia c ritual was wine . It was supposed to produc e the symboli c lowering o f consciousnes s necessary to introduc e the novic e into the closely guarded secrets o f nature , whose essence was expressed by a symbol o f erotic fulfillment: the god Dionysus joined with Ariadne , his consort, in a sacred marriag e ceremony . In time the rites o f Dionysus lost their emo - tive religious power. Ther e emerged an almos t oriental longing for liberation from their exclusive preoccupation with the purely natura l symbols o f life and love. Th e Dionysia c religion, shifting constantly from spiritual to physical a nd back again, perhaps proved too wild and turbulent for some mor e asceti c souls. Thes e cam e to experienc e their religious ecstasies inwardly, in the worship o f Orpheus . Orpheus was probabl y a real man , a singer, prophet, and teacher, who was martyred and I 4 I whose tom b becam e a shrine. No wonde r the early Christian church saw in Orpheus the prototype o f Christ. Both religions brought to the late Hellenisti c world the promise o f a future divine life. Becaus e they were men, yet also mediator s of the divine , for the multitude s o f the dying Grecia n cultur e in the days o f the Roma n Empir e they held the longed-for hope of a future life. There was, however, one important differenc e between the religion ol Orpheu s and the religion of Christ. Thoug h sublimated into a mystical form, the Orphi c mysteries kept alive the old Dionysiac religion. Th e spiritual impetus cam e from a demi-god, in whom was preserved the most significant cpiality of a religion rooted in the art o f agriculture . That cpiality was the old pattern o f the fertility gods w ho cam e only for the season in othe r words , the eternally recurrent cycl e o f birth, growth, fullness, and decay. Christianity, on the othe r hand, dispelled the mysteries . Christ was the produc t and reforme r of a patriarchal, nomadic , pastoral religion, whose prophet s represented their Messiah as a being of absolutely divine origin. The Son o f Man . though born o f a huma n virgin, had his beginning in heaven, whenc e he cam e in an act of God' s incarnation in man. Alte r his death, he returned to heaven but returned onc e and for all. to reign on the right hand ol G od until the Second Comin g "whe n the dead shall arise." O f course the asceticism of early Christianity did not last. Th e memor y o f the cycli c mysteries haunted its followers to the extent that the Churc h eventually had to incorporat e many practices from the pagan past into its rituals. T h e most meaningful ol these may be found in the old records o f what was done on Holy Saturday and Easte r Sunday in celebration o f the resurrection of Christ the baptisma l service that the medieval church made into a suitabl e and deeply meaningful initiation rite. But that ritual has scarcely survived into modern times , and it is completely absent in Protestantism. T h e ritual that has survived muc h better, a nd that still contains the meanin g o f a centra l initiation mystery for the devout, is the Catholi c practic e o f the elevation o f the chalice . It has been described by Dr. Jun g in his "Transformation Symbolism in the Mass" : "Th e lifting up of the chalic e in the air prepares the spiritualization . . . o f the wine. This is confirmed by the invocation to the Holy 142 Ghost that immediately follows. . . . Th e invocation serves to infuse the wine with holy spirit, lor it is the Holy Ghos t who begets , fulfills, and transforms. . . . After the elevation, the chalic e was, in forme r times , set down to the right o f the Host, to correspond with the blood that flowed from the right side o f Christ." T h e ritual of communio n is everywher e the same, whethe r it is expressed by drinking o f the cup of Dionysus or o f the holy Christian cha - lice; but the level ol awarenes s each brings to (he individual participant is different. The Dionysiac participant looks back to the origin ol things, to the "storm-birth " o f the god who is blasted from the resistant wom b o f Mothe r Earth. In the frescoes o f the Vill a de Misteri in Pompeii, the enacted rite evoked the god as a mask of terror reflected in the cup o f Dionysus offered by the priest to the initiate. Eate r we find the winnowing basket, with its precious fruits of the earth, and the phallus as creative symbols o f the god' s manifestation as the principle o f breeding and growth. In contras t to this backward look, with its central focus on nature' s eternal cycle o f birth and death, the Christian mystery points forward to the initiate' s ultimat e hope of union with a transcendent god. Mothe r Nature , with Above , a Dionysiac ritual depicte d on the great fresco in the Villa of the Mysteries at Pompeii. In the center an initiate is offered the ceremonial cu p of Dionysus , in whic h he sees a reflection of the god-mas k held behind .

I 4 4 all her beautiful seasonal changes , has been left behind, and the centra l figure of Christianity offers spiritual certainty, for he is the Son o f God in heaven. Yet the two somehow fuse in the figure of Orpheus , the god who remember s Dionysus but looks forward to Christ. Th e psychological sense of this intermediat e figure has been de - scribed by the Swiss autho r Linda Fierz-David, in her interpretation o f the Orphi c rite pictured in the Vill a de Misteri: "Orpheu s taught while he sang and played the lyre, and his singing was so powerful that it mastered all nature ; when he sang to his lyre the birds flew about him, the fish left the water and sprang to him. Th e wind and the sea became still, the rivers flowed upward toward him. It did not snow and there was no hail. Tree s and the very stones followed after Orpheus ; tiger and lion lay down nea r him next to the sheep, and the wolves next to the stag and the roe. Now wha t does this mean ? It surely means that through a divine insight into the meaning o f natura l event s . . . nature' s happenings becom e harmoniously ordered from within. Everything become s light and all crea - tures appeased when the mediator, in the act of worshiping, represent s the light of nature . Orpheus is an embodimen t o f devotion and piety; he symbolizes the religious attitude that solves all conflicts , since thereby the whol e soul is turned toward that which lies on the othe r side of all conflict. . . . And as he does this, he is truly Orpheus ; that is, a good shepherd, his primitive embodiment. . . ." Both as good shepherd and as mediator. Orpheus strikes the balanc e between the Dio - nysiac religion and the Christian religion, since we find both Dionysus and Chris t in similar roles, though, as I have said, differently oriented as to time and direction in space one a cyclic religion of the nethe r world, the othe r heavenly and eschatological, or final. Thi s series of initiatory events , drawn from the contex t o f religious history, is repeated endlessly and with practically every conceivabl e individual twist o f meaning in the dreams and fantasies o f modern people. In a state o f heavy fatigue and depression, a woma n undergoing analysis had this fantasy: I sit on the side of a long narrow table in a high vaulted room with no window. My body is hunched over and shrunken. There is nothing over me but a long white linen cloth that hangs from my shoulders to the floor. Something crucial has happened to me. There is not much life lelt in me. Red crosses on gold disks appear before my eyes. I recall that I have made some sort of commitment a long time ago and wherever I am now must be part of this. I sit there a long time. Now I slowly open my eyes and I see a man who sits beside me who is to heal me. He appears natural and kind and he is talking to me though I don't hear him. He seems to know all about where I have been. I am aware that I am very ugly and that there must be an odor of death around me. I wonder if he will be repelled. 1 look at him for a very long time. He does not turn away. I breathe more easily. Then I feel a cool breeze, or cool water, pour over my body. I wrap the white linen cloth across me now and prepare for a natural sleep. The man's healing bands are on my shoulders. I recall vaguely that there was a time when there were wounds there but the pressure of his hands seems to give me strength and healing. Thi s woma n had previously felt threatened bv doubt s about he r original religious affiliation. Sh e had been brought up as a devout ' 4 5 Catholi c of the old school, but since he r youth she had struggled to free herself from the formal religious conventions followed by he r family. Ye t the symboli c events o f the church year and the richnes s o f her insight into their meaning remained with he r throughout the process o f her psychological change ; and in he r analysis I found this working knowledge o f religious symbolism most helpful. T h e significant element s she singled out o f her fantasy were the whit e cloth, which she understood as a sacrificial cloth ; the vaulted room, which she considered to be a tomb ; and her commitment, which she associated with the experienc e o f submission. Thi s commitment , as she called it, suggested a ritual o f initiation with a perilous descent into the vault o f death, which symbolized the way she had left church and family to experienc e Go d in he r own fashion. S he had undergone an "imitatio n o f Christ" in the true symboli c sense, and like him she had suffered the wounds that preceded this death. T h e sacrificial cloth suggests the winding sheet or shroud in which the crucified Chris t was wrapped and then placed in the tomb . Th e end o f the fantasy introduce s the healing figure o f a man , loosely associated with me as her analys t but appearing also in his natura l role as a friend fully awar e o f he r experience . H e speaks to her in words she canno t yet hear, but his hands ar e reassuring and give a sense o f healing. On e senses in this figure the touch and the word o f the good shepherd, Orpheu s or Christ, as mediato r and also, o f course , as healer. H e is on the side of life and has to convinc e he r that she ma y now com e back from the vault o f death. Shall we call this rebirth or resurrection? Both, perhaps , or neither. Th e essential rite proclaims itself at the end : Th e cool breeze or wate r flowing ove r he r body is the primordia l a c t o f purification or cleansing o f the sin of death, the essence o f true baptism. T h e same woma n had anothe r fantasy in which she felt that he r birthday fell upon the d ay o f Christ' s resurrection. (Thi s was much mor e meaningful for he r than the memor y o f he r mother, who had neve r given he r the feel146 ing of reassurance and renewa l she so much wished for on he r childhood birthdays.) But this did not mea n she identified herself with the figure o f Christ. Fo r all his powe r and glory, something was lacking ; and as she tried to reach him through prayer, he and his cross were lifted up to heaven out o f he r human reach. In this second fantasy she fell bac k upon the symbol of rebirth as a rising sun, and a new feminine symbol began to mak e its appearance . First of all it appeared as an "embry o in a watery sack." The n she was carrying an eightyear-old boy through the wate r "passing a danger point." The n a new movemen t occurred in which she no longe r felt threatened or unde r the influence o f death. Sh e was "i n a forest by a little spring waterfall . . . green vines grow all around. In my hands I have a stone bowl in which there is spring water, some green moss, and violets. I bath e myself unde r the waterfall. It is golden and 'silky' and I feel like a child." T he sense o f these event s is clear, though it is possible to miss the inne r meanin g in the cryptic description o f so man y changin g images . Here we have , it seems , a process o f rebirth in which a larger spiritual self is reborn and baptized in natur e as a child. Meanwhil e she has rescued an olde r child who was , in some way, her own ego at the mos t traumati c period o f her childhood. Sh e then carried it through water past the dange r point, thus indicating her fear of a paralyzing sense of guilt if she should depart too far from he r family' s conventiona l religion. But religious symbolism is significant by its absence . All is in the hands o f nature ; we ar e clearly in the realm o f the shepherd Orpheus rathe r than the risen Christ. A dream followed this sequence , which brought he r to a church resembling the church in Assisi with Giotto' s frescoes o f St. Francis . S h e felt mor e at hom e her e than she would in othe r churche s becaus e St. Francis , like Orpheus , was a religious ma n o f nature . Thi s revived he r feelings about the chang e in he r religious affiliation that had been so painful to undergo, but now she believed she could joy - fully face the experience , inspired by the light o f nature . T h e series o f dreams ended with a distant echo o f the religion o f Dionysus . (On e could say that this was a reminde r that even Orpheus c an at times be a little too far removed from the fecundating powe r o f the animal-god in man.) Sh e dreamed that she was leading a fairhaired child by the hand. "W e ar e happily participating in a festival that includes the sun a nd the forests and flowers all around. Th e child has a little whit e flower in he r hand, and she places it on the head o f a black bull. Th e bull is part o f the festival and is covered with festive decorations." Thi s referenc e recall s the ancient rites that celebrated Dionysus in the guise o f a bull. But the drea m did not end there . Th e woma n added : "Som e time late r the bull is Above left, the Persian go d Mithra s sacrificing the bull. The sacrifice (also part of Dionysiac rites) can be seen as a symbol of the victor y of man's spiritual nature over his animality—of whic h the bul l is a common symbol. (This may explain the popularity in some countries of bullfighting, left.) Right, an etching by Picasso (1 935 ) depict s a girl threatened by a Minotaur — here, as in the myt h of Theseus, a symbol of man' s uncontrollabl e instinctive forces. pierced by a golden arrow." Now, besides Dionysus , there is anothe r pre-Christian rite in which the bull plays a symboli c role. The Persian sun-god Mithra s sacrifices a bull. He , like Orpheus , represent s the longing for a life of the spirit that might triumph over the primitive anima l passions o f ma n and, after a ceremony o f initiation, give him peace . Thi s series o f image s confirms a suggestion that is found in man y fantasy or dream sequence s of this type that there is no final peace , no resting point. In their religious quest m en and women — especially those who live in modern Western Christianized societies — ar e still in the powe r o f those early traditions that strive within them for supremacy, It is a conflict of pagan or Christian beliefs, or, one might say, o f rebirth or resurrection. A mor e direc t clue to the solution of this dilemma is to be found, in this woman' s first fantasy, in a curious piece o f symbolism that could easily be overlooked. Th e woma n says that in he r death vault she saw before he r eyes a vision o f red crosses on gold disks. As becam e clea r later in he r analysis , she was about to experienc e a profound psychic chang e and to emerg e out o f this "death " into a new kind of life. W e might imagine , therefore , that this image , which cam e to he r in the depth o f her despair o f life, should in some way herald her future religiousattitude . In her subsequent work she did in fact produc e evidenc e for thinking that the red crosses represented her devotion to the Christian attitude , while the gold disks represented he r devotion to the pre-Christian mystery religions . He r vision had told her that she must reconcil e these Christian and pagan element s in the new life that lay ahead. O n e last, but important, observation concerns the ancient initiation rites and their relation to Christianity. The initiation rite celebrated in the Eleusinian mysteries (the rites o f worship o f the fertility goddesses Demete r and Persephone ] was not considered appropriat e merely for those who sought to live life mor e abundantly ; it was also used as a preparation for death, as if death also required an initiatory rite o f passage o f the same kind. O n a funeral urn found in a Roma n grave nea r the Columbariu m on the Esquiline Hill we find a clea r bas-relie f representing scenes o f the final stage o f initiation wher e the novice is admitted to the presenc e and convers e o f the goddesses. Th e rest o f the design is devoted to two preliminary ceremonie s o f purification— the sacrifice o f the "mysti c pig," and a mysticized version o f the sacred marriage . Thi s all points to an initiation into death, but in a form that lacks the finality o f mourning. It hints at that element o f the later mysteries — especially of Orphis m which make s death carry a promise o f immortality. Christianity went even further. It promised something mor e than immortality (which in the old sense o f the cycli c mysteries might merely mea n reincarnation), for itoffered the faithful an everlasting life in heaven. S o we see again, in modern life, the tendency to repeat old patterns . Thos e who have to learn to face death ma y have to relearn the old message that tells us that death is a mystery for which we must prepar e ourselves in the same spirit of submission and humility as we onc e learned to prepar e ourselves for life. i 4 « Symbols of transcendence The symbols that influenc e man vary in their purpose. Som e men need to be aroused, and experience their initiation in the violence o f a Dionysiac "thunde r rite." Other s need to be subdued, and they ar e brought to submission in the ordered design o f templ e precinc t or sacred cave, suggestive o f the Apollonian religion of later Greece . A full initiation embrace s both themes, as we can see when we look eithe r at the material drawn from ancient texts or at living subjects . But it is quit e certain that the fundamental goal o f initiation lies in taming the original Trickster-like wildness o f the juvenil e nature. It therefore has a civilizing or spiritualizing purpose, in spite o f the violenc e o f the rites that ar e required to set this process in motion. Ther e is, however, anothe r kind o f symbolism, belonging to the earliest known sacred traditions, that is also connected with the periods of transition in a person s life. But these symbol s do not seek to integrat e the initiate with any religious doctrine or secular group-conscious - ness. O n the contrary, they point to man' s need for liberation from any state o f being that is too immature , too fixed or final. In othe r words , they concern man' s release from or transcendenc e of—an y confining pattern o f existence , as he moves toward a superior or mor e matur e stage in his development. A child, as I have said, possesses a sense o f completeness , but only before the initial emergenc e o f his ego-consciousness . In the case o f an adult, a sense o f completenes s is achieved through a union of" the consciousnes s with the unconscious content s o f the mind. Ou t o f this union arises wha t Jun g called "th e transcendent function o f the psyche," by which a man c an achieve his highest goal : the full realization o f the potential o f his individual Self. Both a bird and a shaman (i.e. a primitive medicine man) are common symbol s of transcendence, and often are combined : Left, a prehistoric cave painting at Lascaux shows a shaman in a bird mask. Below, a shaman priestess of a Siberian people, in a bird costume. Right, a shaman's coffin (also Siberian) with bird figures on the posts 149 Thus , wha t we call "symbol s of transcendence " ar e the symbol s that represent man' s striving to attain this goal. The y provide the means by which the content s o f the unconscious can ente r the conscious mind, and they also are themselves an active expression o f those contents. Thes e symbol s ar e manifold inform . Whethe r we encounte r them in history or in the dreams of contemporar y men and wome n who ar e at a critical stage in their lives, we can see their importance . At the mos t archai c level o f this symbolism we again mee t the Trickste r theme . But this time he no longe r appear s as a lawless would-be hero. H e has becom e the shaman the medicine ma n —whos e magica l practices and flights o f intuition stamp him as a primitive master of initiation. His powe r resides in his supposed ability to leave his body and fly about the universe as a bird. In this case the bird is the most fitting symbol of transcendence . It represent s the peculiar natur e of intuition working through a "medium," that is, an individual who is capabl e of obtaining knowledge o f distant event s —o r facts of which he consciously knows nothing— by going into a trancelike state. Evidenc e o f such power s can be found as far back as the paleolithi c period of prehistory, as the America n schola r Josep h Campbel l has pointed out in commentin g upon one o f the famous cave paintings recently discovered in France . At Lascaux , he writes , "ther e is a sham a n depicted, lying in a trance , wearing a bird mask with a figure o f a bird perched on a staff beside him. Th e shamans o f Siberi a wea r such bird costume s to this day, and man y ar e be - lieved to have been conceived by their mother s from the descent o f a bird ... . Th e shaman , then, is not only a familia r denizen, but even the favored scion o f those realms o f powe r that a r e invisible to our norma l waking conscious - ness, which all ma y visit briefly in vision, but through which he roams , a master." At the highest level of this type o f initiatory activity, far from those tricks-of-the-trade by which magi c so frequently replaces true spiritual insight, we find the Hindu maste r yogis. In their tranc e states they go far beyond the normal categorie s o f thought. O n e o f the commones t dream symbol s for this type o f release through transcendenc e is the theme o f the lonely journe y or pilgrimage , which someho w seems to be a spiritual pilgrimln myths or dreams, a lonely tourney often symbolizes the liberation of transcendence. Abov e left, a 1 5th-centur y painting of the poet Dante holding his book (the Divine Comedy) which relates his dream of a journey to hell (lower left of picture), purgatory, and heaven. Far left, an engraving of the lourney made by the pilgrim in the British author Joh n Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1 678) . (Note that the journey is a circular movement towar d an inner center.) This book, too, is tol d as a dream ; left, the pilgrim dreaming . Many people wan t some chang e from a containing pattern of life; but the freedom gained by travel (urged by the "ru n awa y to sea " poster, right) is no substitute for a true inner liberation. ' 5 1 age on which the initiat e become s acquainted with the natur e o f death. But this is not death as a last judgmen t or othe r initiatory trial of strength; it is a journe y o f release, renuncia - tion, and atonement, presided over and fostered by some spirit o f compassion. Thi s spirit is mor e often represented by a "mistress " rathe r than a "master" o f initiation, a supreme feminine (i.e. anima ) figure such as Kwan-Yi n in Chinese Buddhism, Sophi a in the Christian-Gnosti c doctrine , or the ancient Gree k goddess o f wisdom Pallas Athena . Not only the flight o f birds or the journe y into the wilderness represent s this symbolism, but any strong movemen t exemplifying release. I n the first part o f life, when one is still attached to the original family and social group, this m a y be experienced as that momen t of initiation at which one mus t learn to take the decisive steps into life alone . It is the momen t that T . S. Eliot describes in "Th e Wast e Land, " when one faces The awful daring of a moment's surrender, which an age of prudence can never retract. At a.late r period oflif e one ma y not need to break all ties with the symbol s o f meaningful containment. But nonetheles s one can be filled with that spirit o f divine discontent which forces all free men to face some new discovery or to live their lives in a new way. Thi s chang e may becom e especially important in the period be - tween middl e age and old age , which is the time in life when so man y people ar e considering wha t to do in their retirement whethe r to work or to play, whethe r to stay at hom e or to travel. If their lives have been adventurous , insecure, or full o f change , they ma y long for a settled life and the consolations o f religious certainty. B ut if they have lived chiefly within the social pattern in which they wer e born, they may desperately need a liberating change . Thi s need m a y be filled, temporarily, by a trip around the world, or by nothing mor e than a move to a smalle r house. But none o f these external change s will serve unless ther e has been some inne r transcendenc e o f old values in creating, not jus t inventing, a new pattern oflife . A case o f this latte r sort is a woma n who h ad lived in a style oflif e that she, her family, a nd friends had long enjoyed becaus e it was so well rooted, culturally nourishing, and secure from transitory fashions. Sh e had this dream : I found some strange pieces of wood, not carved but with natural beautiful shapes. SomeLeft, the British explorer R. F. Scott a nd his companions , photographe d in the Antarcti c in 1911 . Explorers, venturing into the unknown , provide an apt image of the liberation, the breaking out of containment , that characterizes transcendence. The symbol of the snake is commonl y linked wit h transcendence, because it wa s traditionally a creature of the underworl d — and thus wa s a "mediator" betwee n one wa y of life and another. Right, the snake and staff symbo l of the Greco-Roma n g o d of medicine Asklepios on a card used to identify a doctor' s car in moder n France. > 5 2 one said: '"Neanderthal man brought them." Then I saw at a distance these Neanderthal men looking like a dark mass, but I could not see one of them distinctly. I thought I would take back from this place a piece of their wood. Then I went on, as if on a journey by myself, and I looked down into an enormous abyss like an extinct volcano. Ther e was water in part of it and there I expected to see more Neanderthal men. But instead I saw black water pigs that had come out of the water and were running in and out of the black volcanic rocks. In contras t to this woman' s family attachments and he r highly cultivated style o f life, the dream takes he r to a prehistori c period more primitive than anything we can visualize. She can find no social group amon g these ancient men : Sh e sees them as an embodimen t of a truly unconscious , collective "dar k mass " in the distance . Ye t they ar e alive, and she may carry away a piec e o f their wood. Th e dream emphasizes that the wood is natural, not carved ; therefore it come s from a primordial, not a culturally conditioned, level o f the unconscious . T he piece o f wood, remarkabl e for its great age, links this woman' s contemporar y experienc e to the distant origins o f huma n life. We know from man y example s that an ancient tree or plant represent s symbolically the growth and development of psychic life (as distinct from instinctual life, commonl y symbolized by animals). Hence , in this piece o f wood, this woma n acquired a symbol o f her link with the deepes t layers o f the collective unconscious . Nex t she speaks o f continuing her journe y alone . Thi s theme , as I have already pointed out, symbolizes the need for release as an initiatory experience . S o here we have anothe r symbol of transcendence . Then , in the dream , she sees a huge crate r of an extinc t volcano , which has been the channe l for a violent eruption o f fire from the deepest layers o f the earth. W e can surmise that this refers to a significant memor y trace , which leads back to a traumati c experience . Thi s she associated to a personal experienc e early in her life when she had felt the destructive , yet creative , force o f he r passions to such an extent that she feared she would go out o f her mind. Sh e had found, in late adolescence , a quit e unexpected need to break awa y from her family' s exces - sively conventiona l social pattern. She had achieved this break without serious distress, and had been abl e to return eventually to make her peac e with the family. But there lingered a profound wish to make a still greate r differentiation from her family background and to find freedom from he r own pattern o f existence. Thi s dream recalls another. It cam e from a young ma n who had a totally different problem b ut who seemed to need a similar type o f insight. H e too had the urge to achieve differentiation. He dreamed o f a volcano, and from its crate r he saw two birds taking flight as if in fear that the volcano was about to erupt. Thi s was in a strange , lonely plac e with a body of wate r between him and the volcano. In this case , the dream represented an individual initiation journey . . It is similar to cases reported amon g the simple food-gathering tribes, which are the least family-conscious groups we know. In these societies the young initiate must take a lonely journe y to a sacred plac e (in Indian cultures o f the North Pacifi c coast, it ma y actually be a crate r lake) where , in a visionary or trancelike state, he encounter s his "guardia n spirit" in the ' 5 3 form o f an animal , a bird, or natura l object. H e closely identifies himself with this "bus h souT'an d thereby becomes a man . Withoutsuc h an experienc e he is regarded, as an Achumau i medicine ma n put it, as "a n ordinary Indian, nobody." T h e young man' s drea m cam e at the beginning o f his life, and it pointed to his future independenc e and identity as a man . Th e woma n I have described was approachin g the end o f her life, and she experienced a similar journey and seemed to need to acquir e a similar independence . Sh e could live out the remainde r o f her days in harmon y with an eternal huma n law that, by its antiquity, transcended the known symbol s o f culture . But such independenc e does not end in a state o f yogi-like detachmen t that would mean a renunciation o f the world with all its impurities. In the otherwise dead and blasted landscape o f he r drea m the woma n saw signs of anima l life. Thes e ar e "wate r pigs," unknown to he r as a species. The y therefore would carry the meanin g o f a special type o f animal , one tha t can live in two environments , in wate r or on the earth. Thi s is the universal quality o f the anima l as a symbol o f transcendence . Thes e creatures , figuratively comin g from the depths o f the ancient Earth Mother, ar e symboli c denizens of the collective unconscious . The y bring into the field o f consciousnes s a special chthoni c (underworld) message that is somewha t different from the spiritual aspirations symbolized by the birds in the young man' s dream . Othe r transcendent symbol s o f the depths are rodents , lizards , snakes , and sometime s fish. These ar e intermediat e creature s that combin e underwate r activity and the bird-flight with an intermediat e terrestrial life. Th e wild duck or the swan ar e cases in point. Perhaps the commones t dream symbol o f transcendenc e is the snake , as represented by the therapeuti c symbol of the Roma n god of medicine Aesculapius , which has survived to modern times as a sign o f the medical profession. Thi s was originally a nonpoisonous tree snake ; as we sec it, coiled around the staff o f the healing god, it seems to embod y a kind o f mediation between earth and heaven. A still mor e important and widespread symbol o f chthoni c transcendenc e is the motif of the two entwined serpents . Thes e ar e the famous Nag a serpent s o f ancient India ; and we also find them in Greec e as the entwined serpents on the end o f the staff belonging to the god Hermes . An early Grecia n herm is a stone pillar with a bust o f the god above . O n one side ar e the entwined serpent s and on the othe r an erec t phallus . As the serpent s ar e represented 1 5 4 Left, a 17th-centur y Frenc h painting reveal s th e snake' s rol e a s mediator betwee n thi s worl d an d th e next.

' 5 5 in the ac t o f sexual union and the erect phallus is unequivocally sexual, we can draw certain conclusions about the function o f the herm as a symbol o f fertility. But we ar e mistaken if we think this only refers to biological fertility. Herme s is Trickste r in a different role as a messenger, a god o f the cross-roads , and finally the leader o f souls to a nd from the underworld. His phallus therefore penetrate s from the known into the unknown world, seeking a spiritual message o f deliveranc e and healing. Originally in Egypt Herme s was known as the ibis-headed god Thoth , and therefore wa s conceived as the bird form o f the transcendent principle. Again, in the Olympia n period o f Greek mythology, Herme s recovered attribute s o f the bird life to add to his chthoni c natur e as serpent. His staff acquired wings abov e the serpents , becomin g the caduceus or winged staff o f Mercury , and the god himself becam e the "flying man " with his winged hat and sandals . Her e we see his full powe r o f transcendence , whereby the lower transcendenc e from underworld snake-consciousness , passing through the medium o f earthly reality, finally attains transcendenc e to superhuma n or transpersonal reality in its winged flight. Suc h a composit e symbol is found in othe r representations as the winged horse or winged dragon or othe r creature s that abound in the artisti c expressions of alchemy , so fully illustrated in Dr. Jung' s classic work on this subject. W e follow the innumerabl e vicissitudes o f these symbol s in our work with patients . The y show wha t our therapy can expec t to achieve when it liberates the deepe r psychic content s so that they can becom e part o f our conscious equipment for understanding life mor e effectively. It is not easy for modern ma n to grasp the significanc e o f the symbol s that com e down to us from the past or that appea r in our dreams . N or is it easy to see how the ancient conflict between symbol s ofcontainmen t and liberation Winge d dragons (above, from a 15th - century manuscript) combin e the transcendent symbolis m of the snake and the bird.

' 5 7 The process of individuation M.-L. von Franz The rose windo w of the cathedral of Notre Dame, Paris 3 The pattern of psychic growth At the beginning o f this book Dr. C. G. Jun g introduced the reade r to the concept o f the unconscious , its personal and collective structures , a nd its symboli c mode of expression. Onc e one has seen the vital importanc e (that is, the healing or destructive impact) o f the symbol s produced by the unconscious , there remains the difficult problem o f interpretation. Dr. Jun g has shown that everything depends on whethe r any particula r interpretation "clicks " and is mean - ingful to the individual concerned. In this way he has indicated the possible meanin g and func - tion o f dream symbolism. But, in the development o f Jung' s theory, this possibility raised anothe r question: Wha t is the purpose o f the total drea m life o f the individual ? Wha t role do dreams play, not only in the immediat e psychi c econom y o f the hum an being, but in his life as a whole ? By observing a great man y people and studying their dreams (he estimated that he interpreted at least 80,00 0 dreams), Jun g discovered not only that all dreams ar e relevant in varying degrees to the life o f the dreamer, but that they are all parts o f one great we b o f psychological factors, fcle also found that, on the whole , they seem to follow an arrangemen t or pattern. Thi s pattern Jun g called "th e process o f individuation." Sinc e dreams produc e different scenes and images every night, people who ar e not careful observers will probabl y be unawar e o f any pattern. But if one watche s one' s own dreams over a period o f years and studies the entire sequence , one will see that certain contents emerge , disappear, and then turn up again. Man y people even dream repeatedly of the same figures, landscapes , or situations ; and if one follows these through a whol e series, one will see that they chang e slowly but perceptibly. Thes e change s can be accelerated if the dream - er's conscious attitude is influenced by appro - priate interpretation o f the dreams and their symboli c contents . Below , a "meander" (a decoratio n in a seventh-centur y manuscript). Individual dreams seem as strange a nd fragmente d as the detail, above, from the decoration; but over a lifetime's dreaming , a meandering pattern appears -revealin g the process of psychic growt h i bo The process of individuation Thu s our dream life creates a meandering pattern in which individual strands or tendencies becom e visible, then vanish, then return again. If one watche s this meandering design over a long period o f time , one can observe a sort o f hidden regulating or directing tendency at work, creating a slow, imperceptibl e process of psychic growth the process o f individuation. Graduall y a wider and mor e matur e personality emerges , and by degrees become s effective and even visible to others . Th e fact that we often speak o f "arrested development" shows that we assume that such a process o f growth and maturation is possible with every individual. Sinc e this psychic growth canno t be brought about by a conscious effort o f will power, but happens involuntarily and naturally, it is in dreams frequently symbolized by the tree, whose slow, powerful, involuntarygrowth fulfills a definite pattern. T h e organizing cente r from which the regulatory effect stems seems to be a sort of "nu - clear atom " in our psychic system. On e could also call it the inventor, organizer, and source of dream images . Jun g called this cente r the "Self" and described it as the totality of the whole psyche , in orde r to distinguish it from the "ego, " which constitutes only a small part of the total psyche. Throughout the ages men have been intuitively awar e o f the existenc e o f such an inne r center. Th e Greeks called it man' s inne r daimon; in Egypt it was expressed by the concept of the Ba-soul; and the Roman s worshiped it as the "genius " native to each individual. In more primitive societies it was often thought o f as a protective spirit embodied within an animal or a fetish. Thi s inne r cente r is realized in exceptionally pure, unspoiled form by the Naskapi Indians , who still exist in the forests o f the Labrado r peninsula. Thes e simple people ar e hunter s who live in isolated family groups , so far from one The psyche can be compare d to a sphere wit h a bright field (A) o n its surface, representing consciousnes s The ego is the field's center (onl y if " I " kno w a thin g is it conscious ) The Self is at onc e the nucleus and the whol e sphere (B) ; its internal regulating processes produc e dreams anothe r that they have not been abl e to evolve tribal customs or collective religious beliefs and ceremonies . In his lifelong solitude the Naskapi hunte r has to rely on his own inne r voices and unconscious revelations ; he has no religious teacher s who tell him wha t he should believe, no rituals , festivals, or customs to help him along. In his basic view oflife , the soul o f man is simply an "inne r companion," whom he calls " m y friend" or Mista'peo, meaning "Grea t Man. " Mista'pe o dwells in the heart and is immortal ; in the momen t of death, or shortly before , he leaves the individual, and later reincarnate s himself in anothe r being. Thos e Naskapi wh o pay attention to their dreams and who try to find their meaning and test their truth can ente r into a deepe r connec - tion with the Grea t Man . H e favors such people and sends them mor e and bette r dreams . Thu s the majo r obligation of an individual Naskapi is to follow the instructions given by his dreams , and then to give permanent form to their content s in art. Lies and dishonesty drive the (bea t Ma n away from one' s inne r realm, whereas generosity and love o f one' s neighborsandofanimalsattracthimandgivei b i The psyche can he compare d to a sphere wit h a bright field (A) o n its surface, representing consciousnes s The ego is the field's center (onl y if " I " kno w a thin g is it conscious ) The Self is at onc e the nucleus and the whol e sphere (B) ; its internal regulating processes produc e dreams him life. Dream s give the Naskapi complet e ability to find his wa y in life, not only in the inne r world but also in the oute r world o f na - ture. The y help him to foretell the weathe r and give him invaluabl e guidanc e in his hunting, upon which his life depends . I mention these very primitive people becaus e they ar e uncontaminated by our civilized ideas and still have natura l insight into the essence o f wha t Jun g calls the Self. T h e Self can be defined as an inne r guiding factor that is different from the conscious personality and that can be grasped only through the investigation o f one' s own dreams . Thes e show it to be the regulating cente r that brings about a constant extension and maturing o f the personality. But this larger, mor e nearly total aspect o f the psyche appear s first as merely an inborn possibility. It ma y emerg e very slightly, or it ma y develop relatively completely during one' s lifetime. Ho w far it develops depends on whethe r or not the ego is willing to listen to the messages o f the Self. Jus t as the Naskapi have noticed that a person who is receptive to the hints o f the Grea t Ma n gets bette r and mor e helpful dreams , we could add that the inborn Grea t Ma n become s mor e real within the receptive person than in those who neglec t him. Such a person also become s a mor e complet e huma n being. It even seems as if the ego has not been produced by natur e to follow its own arbitrary impulses to an unlimited extent, but to help to mak e real the totality — the whol e psyche. It is the ego that serves to light up the entire system, allowing it to becom e conscious and thus to be realized. If, for example , I have an artistic talent of which my ego is not conscious , nothing will happen to it. Th e gift ma y as well be nonexistent. Onl y if my ego notices it can T bring it into reality. Th e inborn but hidden totality o f the psyche is not the same thing as a whole - ness that is fully realized and lived. O n e could pictur e this in the following way : T h e seed o f a mountain pine contains the whole future tree in a latent form ; but each seed falls at a certain time onto a particula r place , in which there ar e a numbe r o f special factors , such as the quality o f the soil and the stones, the slope o f the land, and its exposure to sun and wind. Th e latent totality o f the pine in the seed react s to these circumstance s by avoiding the stones and inclining toward the sun, with the result that the tree' s growth is shaped. Thu s an individual pine slowly come s into existence , constituting the fulfillment of its totality, its emergenc e into the realm of reality. Withou t the living tree, the imag e o f the pine is only a possibility or an abstrac t idea. Again, the realization o f this uniquenes s in the individual m a n is the goal o f the process o f individuation. Fro m one point o f view this process takes plac e in ma n (as well as in every othe r living being) by itself and in the unconscious ; it is a process by which ma n lives out his innat e hum a n nature . Strictly speaking, however, the process o f individuation is real only if the individual is awar e o f it and consequently make s a living connection with it. W e do not know whethe r the pine tree is awar e o f its own growth, whethe r it enjoys and suffers the different vicissitudes that shape it. But ma n certainly is abl e to participat e consciously in his development. H e even feels that from time to time , by making free decisions , he can cooperat e actively with it. Thi s co-operation belongs to the process o f individuation in the narrowe r sense o f the word. Man , however, experience s something that is not contained in our metapho r o f the pine tree. Th e individuation process is mor e than a comin g to terms between the inborn germ of wholenes s and the oute r act s o f fate. Its subjec - tive experienc e conveys the feeling that some supra-persona l force is actively interfering in a creative way. On e sometime s feels that the unconscious is leading the way in accordanc e with a secret design. It is as if something is looking at me , something that I do not see but that sees me — perhaps that Grea t Ma n in the heart, who tells me his opinions about me by means o f dreams . B ut this creatively active aspec t o f the psychi c nucleus can com e into play only when the ego gets rid o f all purposive and wishful aims a nd tries to get to a deeper, mor e basic form 162 of existence. Th e ego mus t be abl e to listen attentively and to give itself, without any further design or purpose , to that inne r urge toward growth. Man y existentialist philosopher s try to describe this state, but they go only as far as stripping off the illusions o f conscious - ness: The y go right up to the door o f the unconscious and then fail to open it. People living in cultures mor e securely rooted than our own have less troubl e in understanding that it is necessary to give up the utilitarian attitude of conscious planning in orde r to mak e way for the inne r growth o f the personality. I once met an elderly lady who had not achieved much in her life, in terms o f outward achieve - ment. But she had in fact made a good marriage with a difficult husband, and had some - how developed into a matur e personality. Whe n she complained to me that she had not "done " anything in he r life, I told her a story related by a Chinese sage, Chuang-Tzu . She understood immediately and felt great relief. Thi s is the story: A wandering carpenter, called Stone, saw on his travels a gigantic old oak tree standing in a field near an earth-altar. The carpenter said to his apprentice, who was admiring the oak: "Thi s is a useless tree. II you wanted to make a ship, it would soon rot; if you wanted to make tools, they would break. You can't do anything useful with this tree, and that's why it has become so old." But in an inn, that same evening, when the carpenter went to sleep, the old oak tree appeared to him in his dream and said: "Wh y do you compare me to your cultivated trees such as whitethorn, pear, orange, and apple trees, and all the others that bear fruit? Even before they can ripen their fruit, people attack and violate them. Their branches are broken, their twigs are torn. Their own gifts bring harm to them, and they cannot live out their natural span. That is what happens everywhere, and that is why I have long since tried to become completely useless. You poor mortal! Imagine if I had been useful in any way, would I have reached this size? Furthermore, you and I are both creatures, and how can one creature set himself so high as to judge another creature? You useless mortal man, what do you know about useless trees?" T he carpenter woke up and meditated upon his dream, and later, when his apprentice asked him why just this one tree served to protect the earthaltar, he answered, "Keep your mouth shut! Let's hear no more about it! The tree grew here on purpose because anywhere else people would have ill-treated it. If it were not the tree of the earthaltar, it might have been chopped down." T h e carpente r obviously understood his dream . H e saw that simply to fulfill one' s destiny is the greates t huma n achievement, and that our utilitarian notions have to give way in the face o f the demands o f our unconscious psyche; If we translate this metapho r into psychological language , the tree symbolizes the process of individuation, giving a lesson to our shortsighted ego. Unde r the tree that fulfilled its destiny, there was—i n Chuang-Tzu' s story —a n earth-altar. Thi s was a crude , unwrought stone upon which people mad e sacrifices to the local god who "owned " this piece o f land. Th e symbol o f the earth-alta r points to the fact that in orde r to bring the individuation process into reality, one must surrende r consciously to the powe r o f the unconscious , instead o f thinking in terms o f what one should do, or o f what is generally thought right, or o f wha t usually happens . On e must simply listen, in orde r to learn wha t the 163 An earth altar beneath a tree (In a 19th-century Chinese painting ) Such round or square structures usually symbolize the Self, to whic h the ego must submit to fulfill the process of individuation. inne r totality the Self want s one to do here and now in a particula r situation. O u r attitude must be like that of the mountain pine mentioned above : It does not get annoyed when its growth is obstructed by a stone, nor does it make plans about how to overcome the obstacles . It merely tries to feel whethe r it should grow mor e toward the left or the right, toward the slope or away from it. Like the tree, we should give in to this almos t imperceptible , yet powerfully dominating , impulse an impulse that come s from the urge toward unique , creative self-realization. And this is a process in which one must repeatedly seek out and find something that is not yet known to anyone . Th e guiding hints or impulses come , not from the ego, but from the totality o f the psyche : the Self. It is, moreover, useless to cast furtive glances at the way someone else is developing, becaus e each o f us has a unique task of self-realization. Although man y huma n problems ar e similar, they ar e never identical. All pine trees ar e very muc h alike (otherwise we should not recognize them as pines), yet none is exactly the same as another. Becaus e o f these factors o f samenes s a nd difference , it is difficult to summariz e the infinite variations o f the process o f individua - tion. The fact is that each person has to do something different, something that is uniquely his own. Man y people have criticized the Jungian approach for not presenting psychic material systematically. But these critics forget that the materia l itself is a living experienc e charged with emotion, by natur e irrational and everchanging , which does not lend itself to systematization except in the most superficial fashion. Moder n depth psychology has here reached the same limits that confront microphysics . Tha t is, when w e are dealing with statistical averages , a rational and systemati c description o f the facts is possible. But when we ar e attempting to describe a single psychi c event, we can do no mor e than present an honest picture of it from as man y angles as possible. I n the same way, scientists have to admit that they do not know what light is. They can say only that in certain experimenta l conditions it seems to consist o f particles, while in othe r experimenta l conditions it seems to consist o f waves . But what it is "in itself" is not known. The psychology of the unconscious and any description o f the process of individuation encounte r comparabl e difficulties of definition. But I will try here to give a sketch o f some o f their most typical features . The first approach of the unconscious For most people the years of youth ar e characterized by a state of gradua l awakening in which the individual slowly become s awar e o f the world and of himself. Childhood is a period of great emotiona l intensity, and a child' s earliest dreams often manifes t in symboli c form the basic structur e o f the psyche , indicating how it will later shape the destiny of the individual concerned. For example , J ting onc e told a group of students about a young woma n who was so haunted by anxiety that she committed suicide at the age of 26. As a small child, she had dreamed that "Jac k Frost" had entered her room while she was lyiilg in bed and pinched her on the stomach. She woke and discovered that she had pinched herself with her own hand. The dream did not frighten her; she merely remembered that she had bad such a dream. Hut the fact that she did not react emotionally to her strange encounte r with the demon of the cold of congealed life did not augur well for the future and was itself abnormal . It was with a cold, unfeeling hand that she later put an end to her life. From this single dream it is possible to deduc e the tragi c fate o f the dreamer, which was anticipated by her psyche in childhood. Sometime s it is not a dream but some very impressive and unforgettabl e real event that, like a prophecy, anticipate s the future in symbolic form. It is well known that children often forget events that seem impressive to adult s but keep a vivid recollection of some incident or story that no one else has noticed. Whe n we look into one o f these childhood memories , we usually find that it depict s (if interpreted as if it were a symbol) a basic problem o f the child' s psychi c makeup. Whe n a child reache s school age , the phase of building up the ego and of adapting to the oute r world begins . Thi s phase generally brings a numbe r of painful shocks. At the same time , some children begin to feel very different from others , and this feeling of being unique brings a certain sadness that is part o f the loneliness of many youngsters . Th e imperfections of the world, and the evil within oneself as well as outA child, adapting to the outside world , receives man y psychological shocks : far left, the fearful first day at school; center, the surprise a nd pain resulting from an attack by another child, left, the grief a nd bewildermen t of the first experience of death As in effect a protection fro m such shocks, the child may dream or dra w a circular, quadrangular, nuclear motif (above) that symbolizes the all important center of the psyche ' 6 5 side, become conscious problems ; the child must try to cope with urgent (but not yet understood) inner impulses as well as the demands o f the oute r world. If the development o f consciousnes s is disturbed in its norma l unfolding, children frequently retire from oute r or inne r difficulties into an inne r "fortress"; and when that happens, their dreams and symboli c drawings of unconscious materia l often reveal to an unusual degre e a type o f circular, quadrangular, and "nuclear" motif (which I will explain later). This refers to the previously mentioned psychi c nucleus , the vital cente r of the personality from which the whol e structural development of consciousness stems . It is natura l that the image o f the (Cille r shoul d appea r in an especially striking way when the psychic life o f the individual is threatened. From this centra l nucleus (as far as we know today), the whol e building up of ego consciousnes s is directed, the ego apparently be - ing a duplicat e or structural counterpart ol the original center. In this early phase there ar e many children who earnestly seek for some meanin g in life that could help them to deal with the chaos both within and outside themselves . Ther e ar e others , however, who are still unconsciously carried along by the dynamism o f inherited and instinctive archetypa l pat terns. Thes e young people ar e not concerned about the deepe r meanin g oflife , becaus e their experience s with love, nature , sport, and work contain an immediat e and satisfying meaning for them. The y ar e not neces - sarily mor e superficial; usually they ar e carried by the stream of life with less friction and disturbanc e than their mor e introspective fellows. If I travel in a ca r or train without looking out, it is only the stops, starts, and sudden turns that make me realise I am moving at all. T h e actua l process o f individuation the conscious coming-to-terms with one' s own inne r cente r (psychi c nucleus ) or Self—generally be - gins with a wounding of the personality and the suffering that accompanie s it. Thi s initial shock amount s to a sort o f "call, " although it is not often recognized as such. O n the contrary, the ego feels hampered in its will or its desire and usually project s the obstruction onto something external. That is. the ego accuses God or Uneconomi c situation or the boss or the marriagepartne r o f being responsible for whateve r is obstructing it. O r perhaps everything seems outwardly all right, but beneath the surface a person is suffering from a deadly boredom that makes every166 thing seem meaningles s and empty. Man y myths and fairy tales symbolically describe this initial stage in the process o f individuation by telling of a king who has fallen ill or grown old. Other familiar story patterns ar e that a royal couple is barren ; or that a monste r steals all the women, children, horses, and wealth o f the kingdom; or that a demon keeps the king's arm y or his ship from proceeding on its course ; or that darkness hangs over the lands , wells dry up, and flood, drought, and frost afflict the country. Thu s it seems as if the initial encounte r with the Self casts a dark shadow ahead o f time, or as if the "inne r friend" come s at first like a trapper to catch the helplessly struggling ego in his snare . I n myths one finds that the magi c or talisman that can cure the misfortune o f the king or his country always proves to be something very special. In one tale " a whit e blackbird"' or " a fish that carries a golden ring in its gills'" is needed to restore the king's health. In another, the king want s "th e wate r o f life'" or "thre e golden hairs from the head o f the devil" or " a woman's golden plait" (and afterward, naturally, the owne r o f the plait). Whateve r it is, the thing that can drive awa y the evil is always unique and hard to find. It is exactly the same in the initial crisis in the life of an individual. On e is seeking some - thing that is impossible to find or about which nothing is known. In such moment s all wellmeant, sensible advic e is completely useless - advic e that urges one to try to be responsible, to take a holiday, not to work so hard (or to work harder), to have mor e (or less) huma n contact, or to take up a hobby. None o f that helps, or at best only rarely. Ther e is only one thing that seems to work ; and that is to turn directly toward the approachin g darknes s without pre - judic e and totally naively, and to try to find out wha t its secret aim is and wha t it want s from you. T h e hidden purpose o f the oncomin g darkness is generally something so unusual, so unique a nd unexpected, that as a rule one can find out what it is only by means of dreams and fanta - sies welling up from the unconscious . I f one focuses attention on the unconscious without rash assumptions or emotiona l rejection, it often breaks through in a flow of helpful symboli c images . But not always . Sometime s it first offers a series o f painful realizations o f what is wrong with oneself and one' s conscious attitudes . The n o ne must begin the process by swallowing all sorts o f bitter truths . Far left, a woodcu t fro m a 1 7th - century alchemical manuscript depictsa king wh o has fallen ill — a common symboli c image of the emptiness and boredo m (in the consciousness) that can mark the initial stage of the individuation process. Left, fro m the 1 96 0 Italian film La Dolce Vita, another image of this psychological state: Guests explore the run-dow n interior of a decayed aristocrat's castle. Right, a painting by the moder n Swiss artist Paul Klee entitled Fairy Tale. It illustrates a tale of a young man wh o sought and found the "bluebird of happiness." and so could marry a princess. In many fairy tales such a talisman is necessary to cure illness or misfortune, symbol s of our feelings of emptiness and futility. The realization of the shadow Whethe r the unconscious come s up at first in a helpful or a negative form, after a time the need usually arises to readapt the conscious attitude in a bette r way to the unconscious factors therefore to accept what seems to be "criticism " from the unconscious . Throug h dreams one become s acquainted with aspects of one' s own personality that for various reasons o ne has preferred not to look at too closely. This is what Jun g called "th e realization of the shadow." (H e used the term "shadow " for this unconscious part of the personality becaus e it actually often appear s in dreams in a personified form.) T h e shadow is not the whole o f the unconscious personality. It represent s unknown or little-known attribute s and qualities of the ego — aspect s that mostly belong to the personal sphere and that could jus t as well be conscious . In some aspects , the shadow can also consist o f collective factor s that stem from a sourc e outside the individual' s personal life. Whe n an individual make s an attempt to see his shadow, he become s awar e of (and often ashamed o f those qualities and impulses he denies in himself but can plainly see in othe r people such things as egotism, menta l laziness, a nd sloppiness ; unreal fantasies, schemes , and plots ; carelessness and cowardice ; inordinat e love o f money and possessions in short, all Unlit tie sins about which he might previously have told himself: "Tha t doesn't matter; nobody will notic e it, and in any case othe r people do it too." If you feel an overwhelming rage coming up in you when a friend reproache s you about a fault, you can be fairly sure that at this point you will find a part o f your shadow, o f which you ar e unconscious . It is, of course , natura l to become annoyed when other s who ar e "n o better" criticize you becaus e of shadow faults. But what can you say if your own dreams — an inne r judge in your own being reproach you? Tha t is the momen t when the ego gets caught, and the result is usually embarrassed silence. Afterward the painful and lengthy work o f self-education begins a work, we might say, that is the psychological equivalent of the labor s of Hercules . Thi s unfortunat e hero' s first task, you will remember, was to clean up in one day the Augean Stables , in which hundreds of cattl e had dioppr d theii dung for mai n decade s a task Three examples of a "collective infection'" that can wel d people into an irrational mo b and to whic h the shadow (the dark side of the ego-personality ) is vulnerable Left, a scene from a 1 961 Polish film concernin g 1 7th centur y French nuns wh o were possessed by the devi l " Right, a drawin g by Brueghel depict s the affliction (largely psychosomatic ) called "St Vitus' Dance." whic h wa s widespread in the Middl e Age s Far right, the fiery-cros s emble m of the Ku Klux Klan, the whit e supremac y "secret society " of America s Sout h whos e racial intolerance has often led to acts of mo b violence so enormous that the ordinary morta l would be overcome by discouragement at the mer e thought o f it. T h e shadow does not consist only o f omis - sions. It shows up just as often in an impulsive or inadvertent act. Before one has time to think, the evil remark pops out, the plot is hatched, the wrong decision is made , and one is confronted with results that wer e neve r intended or consciously wanted. Furthermore , the shadow is exposed to collective infections to a muc h greater extent than is the conscious personality. When a man is alone , for instance , he feels relatively all right; but as soon as "th e others " do dark, primitive things , he begins to fear that if he doesn't joi n in, he will be considered a fool. Thus he gives way to impulses that do not really belong to him at all. It is particularly in contacts with people of the same sex that one stumbles over both one' s own shadow and those of other people. Although we do see the shadow in a person of the opposite sex, we ar e usually much less annoyed by it and can mor e easily pardon it. In dreams and myths , therefore , the shadow appeals as a person o f the same sex as that of the dreamer. Th e following dream ma y serve as an example . Th e dreame r was a man o f 4 8 who tried to live very much for and bv himself, working hard and disciplining himself, repressing pleasure and spontaneity to a far greate r extent than suited his real nature . 1 owned and inhabited a very big house in town, and I didn't yet know all its different parts. So I took a walk through it and discovered, mainly in the cellar, several rooms about which I knew nothing and even exits leading into other cellars or into subterranean streets. I felt uneasy when I found that several of these exits were not locked and some had no locks at all. Moreover, there were some laborers at work in the neighborhood who could have sneaked in. . . . When I came up again to the ground floor, I passed a back yard where again I discovered dilferent exits into the street or into other houses. When I tried to investigate them mot e closely, a man came up to me laughing loudly and calling out that we were old pa Is from the elementary school. I remembered him too, and while he was telling me about his life, I walked along with him toward the exit and strolled with him through the streets. There was a strange chiaroscuro in the air as we walked through an enormous circular street and arrived at a green lawn where three galloping horses suddenly passed us. They were beautiful, strong animals, wild but well-groomed, and they had no rider with them. (Had they run away from military service?) T h e maz e o f strange passages, chambers , and unlocked exits in the cellar recalls the old Egyptian representation o f the underworld, which is a well-known symbol o f the unconscious with its unknow n possibilities. It also shows how one is "open " to othe r influences in one' s unconscious shadow side, and how uncanny and alien element s can break in. Th e cellar, one can say, is the basement o f the dreamer' s psyche. In the bac k yard o f the strange building (which represent s the still unperceived psychi c scope o f the dreamer' s personality) an old school friend suddenly turns up. Thi s person obviously personifies anothe r aspect of the dreame r himself—an aspect that had been part of his life as a child but that he had forgotten and lost. It often happens that a person's childhood qualities (for instance , gaiety, irascibility, or perhaps trustfulness) suddenly disappear, and one does not know wher e or how they have gone . It is such a lost characteristi c of the dreame r that now returns (from the back yard) and tries to mak e friends again. Thi s figure probabl y stands for the dreamer' s neglected capacity for enjoying life and for his extraverted shadow side. But we soon learn why the dreame r feels "un - easy "jus t before meeting this seemingly harm - less old friend. Whe n he strolls with him in the street, the horses break loose. Th e dreame r thinks they ma y have escaped from military service (that is to say, from the conscious discipline that has hitherto characterized his life). The fact that the horses have no rider shows that instinctive drives can get awa y from conscious control. In this old friend, and in the horses, all the positive force reappear s that was lacking before and that was badly needed by the dreamer.

The title and gloom y passages of the paintin g express the nature of the first contact wit h the unconsciou s whe n the individuation process begins.

Th e following wa s on e of thos e dreams : A ma n is lying on a couch an d has pulled the cover over his face. H e is a Frenchman , a desperado wh o would take on an y crimina l job . An official is accompanyin g me downstairs, an d I know tha t a plot has been mad e against me : namely, tha t the Frenchma n should kill me as if by chance . (Tha t is how it would look from the outside.) He actually sneaks u p behin d me whe n we approac h the exit, but I am on my guard . A tall, portly ma n (rathe r rich an d influential) suddenly leans against the wall beside me , feeling ill. I quickly gra b the opportunit y to kill the official by stabbin g his heart. "On e only notices a bit of moisture"—this is said like a comment . No w I am safe, for the Frenchma n won't attack me since the ma n wh o gave him his orders is dead . (Probably the official an d the successful portly ma n ar e the same person, the latte r somehow replacing the former.) T h e desperad o represents th e othe r sid e of t h e dreamer—hi s introversio n —whic h ha s reache d a completel y destitut e state .

This wa s his dream : I am in the aisle of a n old churc h filled with people. Togethe r with my mothe r an d my wife, I sit at the end of the aisle in wha t seem to be extra seats. I am to celebrat e the Mass as a priest, an d I have a big Mass book in my hands, or, rather, a prayer book or an antholog y of poems. This book is not familiar to me , an d I canno t find the right text. I am very excited becaus e I hav e to begin soon, and , to ad d to my troubles, my mothe r an d wife distur b me by chatterin g abou t unimportan t trifles. Now the orga n stops, an d everybod y is waiting for me , so I get u p in a determine d wa y and ask one of the nun s wh o is kneeling behind me to han d me he r Mass book an d point out the right plac e which she does in an obliging man - ner. Now, like a sort of sexton, this same nu n pre - cedes me to the altar, which is somewher e behin d me an d to the left, as if we ar e approachin g it from a side aisle. Th e Mass book is like a sheet of pictures, a sort of board , thre e feet long an d a foot wide , an d on it is the text with ancien t pictures in columns, one beside the other. First the nu n has to read a part of the liturgy before I begin, an d 1 hav e still not found the right place in the text. She has told me tha t it is Num - ber 15, but the numbers ar e not clear, an d I can - not find it. Wit h determination , however, I turn toward the congregation , an d now I have found Numbe r 15 (the next to the last on the board), although I d o not yet know if I shall be abl e to decipher it. I wan t to try all the same . I wake up . M e n project the anima on to thing s as wel l as women . For instance, ships are alway s know n as "she"' above, the female figurehead on the old British clipper ship Cutty Sark. The captain of a ship is symbolicall y "her" husband , whic h may be wh y he mus t (accordin g t o tradition) g o dow n wit h the ship if "she " sinks. A car is another kind of possession that is usually feminized — i.e. that can becom e the focus of man y men' s anima projections. Like ships, cars are called "she.' ' and their owner s caress an d pamper the m (below ) like favorite mistresses.

In this drea m th e anim a appears in he r pro - pe r positiv e rol e tha t is. a s a mediato r betwee n the eg o an d th e Self. Th e four-times-fou r con - figuration of th e picture s points to th e fact tha t the celebratio n of this inne r Mass is performe d in th e servic e of totality . As Jun g ha s demon - strated , th e nucleu s of th e psych e (th e Sell" normall y expresse s itself in som e kin d of fourfold structure . Th e numbe r four is als o con - nected wit h th e anim a because , as Jun g noted , ther e ar e four stage s in its development . Th e first stag e is best symbolize d b y th e figur e of Eve, whic h represents purel y instinctua l an d biologica l relations.

Th e fourt h typ e is symbolize d by Sapientia . wisdo m transcendin g eve n th e most holy an d th e most pure . O f this anothe r symbo l is the Shulamit e in th e Son g of Solomon . (I n th e Above , the anima' s third stage is personified asth e Virgin Mar y (in a paintin g by van Eyck). The red of her robe is the symboli c color of feeling (or eros): but in this stage the eros has becom e spiritualized. Below , tw o examples of the fourth stage: the Greek goddes s of wisdo m Athen a (left), and the Mona Lisa. ' 8 5 psychi c developmen t of moder n ma n this stag e is rarel y reached . I h e Mon a Lisa come s nearest t o suc h a wisdo m anima. ) At this stag e I a m onl y pointin g ou t tha t th e concep t of fourfoldness frequentl y occurs in certai n type s o f symboli c material . Th e essen - tial aspects of this will b e discusse d later. B u t wha t doe s th e rol e of th e anim a a s guid e to th e inne r worl d mea n in practica l terms ? This positiv e functio n occurs whe n a ma n take s seriousl y th e feelings, moods, expectations, an d fantasie s sen t b y his anim a an d whe n h e fixes the m in som e form for example , in writing , painting , sculpture , musica l composition , o r dancing .

An d it is essentia l to regar d it as bein g absolutel y real ; ther e must b e n o lurk - i n g doub t tha t this is "onl y a fantasy." " If this is practice d wit h devotio n ove r a lon g period , t h e process of individuatio n graduall y become s t h e singl e realit y an d ca n unfol d in its tru e form. Man y example s from literatur e show th e anim a as a guid e an d mediato r to th e inne r world : Francesc o Colonna's Hypnerolomachia, Ride r Haggard' s She, o r "th e eterna l feminine " in Goethe's Faust. I n a medieva l mystica l text, a n anim a figur e explain s he r ow n natur e as follows: I am the flower of the field an d the lily of the valleys. I am the mothe r of lair love and of fear a n d of knowledg e an d of holy hope . .. . I am the mediato r of the elements, makin g on e to agree witli another; tha t which is warm I mak e cold a n d the reverse, an d tha t which is dry I mak e moist an d the reverse, an d tha t which is hard I soften. .. . I am the law in the priest an d the word in the prophe t an d the counsel in the wise. I will kill an d I will mak e to live an d ther e is non e tha t can deliver out of my hand .

The anima figure seems to parallel the woma n of the Apocalypse , wh o also wor e a crow n of 1 2 stars; antiquity' s moo n goddesses; the O l d Testament' s Sapientia (the fourth stage of the anima, p. 185); and the Egyptian goddes s Isis (wh o also had flowin g hair, a half-moo n at her womb , and stood wit h one foot on land and one on water).

In the painting , right, by the moder n artist Slavko, the Self is separate from the anima but still merged wit h nature. Th e paintin g can be called a "sou l landscape": On the left sits a dark-skinned , naked woma n the anima. O n the right is a bear, the animal soul or instinct Near the anima is a doubl e tree — symbolizin g the individuatio n process in whic h the inner opposites unite In the backgroun d one at first sees a glacier, but on lookin g closely o ne sees that it is also a face. This face (from whic h the lifestream flows ) is the Self.

Above left, the singer Franz Grass in the title role of Wagner' s opera The Flying Dutchman, based on the tale of the sea captain doome d t o sail a ghos t ship unti l a woman' s love breaks the curse on him .

If sh e obeys, th e destruc - tive , tormentin g animu s will b e transforme d int o a creativ e an d meaningfu l activity . As in this dream , th e animu s ofte n appears as a grou p of men . I n this wa y th e unconsciou s symbolize s th e fac t tha t th e animu s represents a collectiv e rathe r tha n a persona l element . Becaus e of this collective-mindedness wome n habituall y refe r (whe n their animu s is speakin g throug h them ) to "one " o r "they " o r "every - body, " an d in suc h circumstance s their speec h frequentl y contain s th e word s "always " an d "should " an d "ought.

T h e animus , just like th e anima , exhibits four stage s of development . H e first appears a s a personificatio n o f mer e physica l power—fo r instance , a s a n athleti c champio n o r "muscl e man.

I n th e thir d phase , th e animu s become s th e "word, " ofte n appearin g a s a professo r o r clergyman . Finally , in his fourt h manifestation , th e animu s is th e incarnatio n of meaning. O n this highest leve l h e become s (like th e anima ) a mediato r of th e religiou s experienc e whereb y life acquire s n e w meaning . H e give s th e woma n spiritua l firmness, a n invisibl e inne r suppor t tha t com - pensate s for he r oute r softness. Th e animu s in his most develope d form sometime s connects t h e woman' s min d wit h th e spiritua l evolutio n Embodiment s of the four stages of the animus : First, the wholl y physical ma n — the fictional lungl e heroTarza n (top, played by Johnn y Weismuller). Second , the "romantic " man — the 19t h centur y British poet Shelley (center left): or the "ma n of action"—America' s Ernest Hemingway , wa r hero, hunter, etc. Third, the bearer of the "word " — Lloyd George, the great political orator Fourth, the wis e guid e to spiritual truth—ofte n projected on to Gandh i (left). Abov e right, an Indian miniature of a girl gazing wit h love at a man' s portrait. A woma n falling in love wit h a picture (or a film star) is clearly projecting her animu s ont o the man . The actor Rudolp h Valentino (right, in a film made in 1 922 ) became the focu s of animu s projection for thousand s of wome n whil e he lived—an d even after he died Far right, part of the immense floral tribute sent by wome n all over the worl d to Valentino' s funeral in 1 92 6 I 'M of he r age , an d ca n thereb y mak e he r eve n mor e receptiv e tha n a ma n to ne w creativ e ideas.

Animu s an d anim a alway s ten d to dra g conversatio n dow n t o a ver y lo w leve l an d t o produc e a disagreeable , irascible , emotiona l atmosphere . As I mentione d before , th e positiv e sid e o f t h e animu s ca n personif y a n enterprisin g spirit, courage , truthfulness, an d in th e highest form, spiritua l profundity .

Onl y the n will th e manifestation s o f th e Self ge t throug h t o her, a n d will sh e b e abl e consciousl y t o understan d their meaning . The Self: symbols of totality If a n individua l ha s wrestle d seriousl y enoug h a n d lon g enoug h wit h th e anim a (o r animus) proble m so tha t he , o r she , is n o longe r partiall y identifie d wit h it, th e unconsciou s agai n change s its dominan t characte r an d appears i n a ne w symboli c form, representin g th e Self, th e inner - most nucleu s of th e psyche . I n th e dream s o f a woma n this cente r is usuall y personifie d a s a superio r femal e figure— a priestess, sorceress, eart h mother , o r goddess of natur e o r love . I n t h e cas e of a man , it manifests itself a s a masculin e initiato r an d guardia n (a n India n guru), a wis e ol d man , a spirit of nature , an d so forth . T w o folk tale s illustrat e th e rol e tha t suc h a figure ca n play . Th e first is a n Austria n tale : A king has ordere d soldiers to keep the night watc h beside the corpse of a black princess, wh o has been bewitched . Every midnigh t she rises an d kills the guard . At last one soldier, whos e tur n it is to stand guard , despairs an d runs awa y into the woods. Ther e he meets a n "ol d guitarist wh o is our Lor d Himself. " This old musician tells him wher e to hide in the churc h an d instructs him on how to behav e so tha t the black princess cannot get him. Wit h this divine hel p the soldier actually manage s to redeem the princess an d marr y her. Clearly , "th e ol d guitarist wh o is ou r Lor d Himself " is, in psychologica l terms, a symboli c personificatio n of th e Self. Wit h his hel p th e e g o avoid s destructio n an d is abl e t o overcom e — an d eve n redee m — a highl y dangerou s aspec t of his anima . I n a woman' s psyche , a s I hav e said , th e Self assume s feminin e personifications. This is illustrate d in th e secon d story , a n Eskim o tale : A lonely girl wh o has been disappointe d in love meets a wizard traveling in a coppe r boat. H e is the "Spirit of the Moon, " wh o has given all the animals to mankin d an d wh o also bestows luck in hunting . H e abducts the girl to the heavenly realm. Once , whe n the Spirit of the Moo n ha s left her, she visits a little house nea r the Moo n Ghost's mansion . Ther e she finds a tiny woma n clothed in the "intestina l membran e of the bearde d seal, " wh o warn s the heroine against the Spirit of the Moon , saying tha t he plans to kill her. (It appears tha t he is a killer of women , a sort of Bluebeard.) Th e tiny woma n fashions a long rop e by mean s of whic h the girl ca n descend to eart h at the time of the new moon , which is the momen t whe n the little woma n can weake n the Moo n Spirit. Th e girl climbs down , bu t whe n she arrives on earth , she does not ope n he r eyes as quickly as the little woma n told he r to. Because of this, she is turne d into a spider an d can neve r become huma n again. A s w e hav e noted , th e divin e musicia n in th e first tal e is a representatio n o f th e "wis e ol d man, " a typica l personificatio n of th e Self. H e is aki n t o th e sorcere r Merli n of medieva l legen d o r to th e Gree k go d Hermes . Th e littl e woma n i n he r strang e membrane-clothin g is a paralle l figure , symbolizin g th e Self as it appears i n th e feminin e psyche . Th e ol d musicia n save s th e her o from th e destructiv e anima , a n d th e littl e woma n protects th e girl against t h e Eskim o "Bluebeard " (wh o is, i n th e for m of t h e Moo n Spirit , he r animus) . I n this case , how - ever, thing s g o wrong— a poin t tha t I shall tak e u p later. T h e Self, however , doe s no t alway s tak e th e for m of a wis e ol d ma n o r wis e ol d woman . Thes e paradoxica l personification s ar e attempts t o express somethin g tha t is no t entirel y con - taine d i n time—somethin g simultaneousl y youn g an d old . Th e drea m of a middle-age d m a n show s th e Self appearin g as a youn g man : Comin g from the street, a yout h rode down into our garden . (Ther e wer e no bushes an d no fence as ther e ar e in real life, an d the garde n lay open.) I did not quit e know if he came on purpose, or if the horse carried him here against his will. I stood on the pat h tha t leads to my studio an d watche d the arriva l with grea t pleasure . Th e sight i g 6 The Self — the inner center of the total psyche — is often personified in dreams as a superior huma n figure To women , the Self might appear as a wise and powerfu l goddess —lik e the ancient Greek mother goddes s Demeter (right, shown wit h her son Triptolemus and daughter Kore. in a fifth - century-B.c. relief). The "fair y godmother" of man y tales is also a symbolic personification of the female Self: above. Cinderella's godmother (from an illustration by Gustave Dore).

Before the boy' s hands hovers a flower—a s if he need onl y raise his hands and a magical flowe r wil l appear. He is black because of his nocturnal (i.e. unconscious ) origin. of the boy on his beautiful horse impressed me deeply. T h e horse wa s a small, wild, powerful animal , a symbol of energy (it resembled a boar), an d it had a thick, bristly, silvery-gray coat. Th e boy rode past me betwee n the studio an d house, jumped off his horse, an d led him carefully awa y so that he would not trampl e on the flower bed with its beautiful red an d orang e tulips. Th e flower bed ha d been newly mad e an d plante d by my wife fa dream occurrence). This yout h signifies th e Self, an d wit h it re - newa l of life, a creativ e elan vital, an d a ne w spiritua l orientatio n b y mean s of whic h every - thin g become s full of life an d enterprise . If a ma n devote s himself to th e instruction s of his ow n unconscious, it ca n besto w this gift, so tha t suddenl y life, whic h ha s bee n stal e an d dull, turn s int o a rich , unendin g inne r adven - ture , full of creativ e possibilities. I n a woman' s psychology , this sam e youthfu l personificatio n of th e Self ca n appea r a s a supernaturall y gifted girl. Th e dreame r in this instanc e is a woma n in he r lat e forties: I stood in front of a churc h an d wa s washin g the pavemen t with water. The n I ra n dow n the street just at the momen t whe n the students from the high school wer e let out. I came to a stagnan t river across which a boar d or tree trun k ha d been laid; but whe n I was attemptin g to walk across, a mischievous studen t bounce d on the boar d so that it cracked an d I nearly fell into the water. "Idiot! " I yelled out. O n the othe r side of the river thre e little girls wer e playing, an d one of them stretched out he r han d as if to help me . I though t tha t he r small han d was not strong enoug h to help me , but whe n I took it, she succeeded, withou t the slightest effort, in pulling me across an d u p the ban k on the othe r side.

Accordin g to th e dream , sh e must no w cross a stagnan t river, an d this indicate s tha t th e flow of life is slowe d dow n becaus e of th e unresolve d religiou s problem . (Crossin g a rive r is a frequen t symboli c imag e for a fundamenta l chang e o f attitude. ) Th e studen t wa s interprete d b y th e dreame r herself a s th e personificatio n of a though t tha t sh e ha d previousl y ha d — namely , tha t sh e migh t satisfy h e r spiritua l yearnin g b y attendin g hig h school .

Whe n sh e dare s t o cross th e rive r alone , a personificatio n of th e Self (th e girl), smal l bu t supernaturall y powerful , help s her. B u t th e form of a huma n being , whethe r youthfu l o r old , is onl y on e of th e man y way s in whic h th e Self ca n appea r in dream s o r visions.

Moreover , it appears frequentl y in a form tha t hints a t a specia l omnipresence ; tha t is, it manifests itself a s a gigantic , symboli c huma n bein g wh o embrace s an d contain s th e whol e cosmos.

" Anothe r threa t to th e inne r balanc e come s from excessiv e daydream - ing, whic h in a secre t wa y usuall y circle s aroun d particula r complexes.

T h e secon d obstacl e is exactl y th e opposite , a n d is du e to a n over-consolidatio n of ego - consciousness . A11 houg h a disc i |)line d conscious - ness is necessar y for th e performanc e of civilize d activitie s (we kno w wha t happen s if a railwa y signalma n lapse s int o daydreaming) , it ha s th e serious disadvantag e tha t it is ap t to bloc k th e receptio n of impulse s an d message s comin g from the center. This is wh y so man y dream s of civilized peopl e ar e concerne d wit h restorin g this receptivit y b y attemptin g to correc t th e attitud e of consciousness towar d th e uncon - scious cente r o r Self. Amon g th e mythologica l representation s of the Self on e finds muc h emphasis o n th e fou r corners of th e world , an d in man y picture s th e Grea t Ma n is represente d in th e cente r of a circle divide d int o four.

Forinstance , th e Navah o Indian s try , b y mean s of mandala-structurc d san d paintings, to brin g a sick perso n bac k int o har - mon y wit h himself an d wit h th e cosmo s an d thereb y to restor e his health . I n Easter n civilization s simila r picture s ar e use d to consolidat e th e inne r being , o r to enabl e o n e to plung e int o dee p meditation . Th e con - templatio n of a mandal a is mean t to brin g a n inne r peace , a feeling tha t life ha s agai n foun d its meanin g an d order . Th e mandal a als o con - vey s this feeling whe n it appears spontaneousl y in th e dream s of moder n me n wh o ar e no t influence d b y an y religiou s traditio n of this sort an d kno w nothin g abou t it. Perhap s th e positiv e effect is eve n greate r in suc h case s becaus e knowledg e an d traditio n sometime s blu r o r eve n bloc k th e spontaneou s experience . A n exampl e of a spontaneousl y produce d mandal a occurs in th e followin g drea m of a 62 - The feelings of boredo m and apathy from whic h city dweller s today often suffer is onl y temporarily offset by such artificial excitement s as adventure films (far left) and timekilling "amusements " (left). Jun g stressed that the onl y real adventure remaining for each individual is the exploration of his ow n unconscious . The ultimate goal of such a search is the formin g of a harmoniou s and balanced relationship wit h the Self The circular mandala images this perfect balance —embodie d in the structure of the moder n cathedral (right) of the city of Brasilia. Top, a Navah o makes a sand painting (a mandala ) in a healing ritual; the patient sits in the painting. Above , a plan of a san d painting ; it mus t be circled by a patient before entering. Left, a winte r landscape by the Germa n artist Kaspar Friedrich Landscape paintings usually express indefinable "moods"—a s d o symboli c landscapes in dreams. year-ol d woman . It emerge d a s a prelud e t o a new phas e of life in whic h sh e becam e ver y creative : I see a landscape in a dim light. In the background I see the rising an d the n evenly continu - ing crest of a hill. Alon g the line wher e it rises moves a quadrangula r disk tha t shines like gold. In the foreground I see dar k plowed eart h tha t is beginning to sprout. No w I suddenl y perceive a round tabl e with a gra y stone slab as its top, an d at the same momen t the quadrangula r disk suddenly stands upo n the table . It has left the hill, but how an d wh y it has change d its plac e I d o not know. Landscape s in dream s (as well a s in art) frequentl y symboliz e a n inexpressibl e mood . I n this dream , th e di m ligh t of th e landscap e indicates tha t th e clarit y of daytim e consciousness is dimmed . "Inne r nature " ma y no w begi n t o revea l itself in its ow n light , so w e ar e tol d tha t the quadrangula r disk become s visibl e o n th e horizon . Hithert o th e symbo l of th e Self, th e disk, ha d bee n largel y a n intuitiv e ide a o n th e dreamer's menta l horizon , bu t nowi n thedrea m it shifts its positio n an d become s th e cente r of the landscap e of he r soul. A seed , sow n lon g ago , begin s to sprout : for a lon g tim e previously th e dreame r ha d pai d carefu l attentio n to he r dreams , an d no w this wor k bears fruit. (On e is reminde d of th e relatio n betwee n th e symbo l of th e Grea t Ma n an d plan t life, whic h I mentione d before.) No w th e golde n disk sud - denl y move s to th e "right " sid e — th e sid e wher e thing s becom e conscious. Amon g othe r thing s "right " often means, psychologically , th e side of consciousness, of adaptation , of bein g "right, " whil e "left " signifies th e spher e of unadapted , unconsciou s reaction s o r sometime s eve n o f somethin g "sinister. " Then , finally, th e golde n disk stop s its movemen t an d come s to rest o n — significantl y — a roun d ston e table . It ha s foun d a permanen t base . As Aniel a Jaff e observe s late r in this book , roundness (th e mandal a motif) generall y sym - bolize s a natura l wholeness, wherea s a quadr - angula r formatio n represents th e realizatio n of this in consciousness. I n th e drea m th e squar e disk an d th e roun d tabl e meet , an d thu s a con - sciou s realizatio n of th e cente r is a t hand . Th e roun d table , incidentally , is a well-know n sym - b o l of wholeness an d play s a i-ole in mytholog y — for instance , Kin g Arthur's roun d table , whic h itself is a n imag e derive d from th e tabl e of th e Last Supper . I n fact, wheneve r a huma n bein g genuinel y turn s to th e inne r worl d an d trie s t o kno w him - self— no t b y ruminatin g abou t his subjectiv e thoughts an d feelings, bu t b y followin g th e ex - pression s of his ow n objectiv e natur e suc h a s dream s an d genuin e fantasie s — the n soone r o r late r th e Self emerges. Th e eg o will the n find a n inne r powe r tha t contain s all th e possibilitie s of renewal . In the paintings, left, of the dream quote d on this page (painted by the dreamer), the mandal a motif appears as a quadrangl e rather than a circle Usually quadrangular form s symbolize consciou s realization of inner wholeness : the wholenes s itself is most often represented in circular forms, such as the roun d table that also appears in the dream. Right, the legendary Roun d Table of King Arthur (fro m a 15th-centur y manuscript), at whic h the Hol y Grail appeared in a vision and started the knight s o n the famou s quest. The Grail itself symbolizes the inner wholenes s for whic h me n have alway s been searching. B u t ther e is a grea t difficulty tha t I hav e mentione d onl y indirectl y u p till now . This is tha t ever y personificatio n of th e unconsciou s — t h e shadow , th e anima , th e animus , an d th e Self — ha s bot h a ligh t an d a dar k aspect . W e sa w befor e tha t th e shado w ma y b e bas e o r evil, a n instinctiv e driv e tha t on e ough t to overcome . It may , however , b e a n impuls e towar d growt h tha t on e shoul d cultivat e an d follow. I n th e sam e wa y th e anim a an d animu s hav e dua l aspects: The y ca n brin g life-givin g developmen t a n d creativeness t o th e personality , o r the y ca n caus e petrificatio n an d physica l death . An d eve n th e Self, th e all-embracin g symbo l o f th e unconscious, ha s a n ambivalen t effect, as for in - stanc e in th e Eskim o tal e (pag e 196), whe n t h e "littl e woman " offere d t o sav e th e heroin e from th e Moo n Spiri t bu t actuall y turne d he r int o a spider. T h e dar k sid e of th e Self is th e most dan - gerou s thin g of all, precisel y becaus e th e Self is th e greatest powe r in th e psyche . It ca n caus e peopl e to "spin " megalomania c o r othe r delusor y fantasie s tha t catc h the m u p an d "possess " them . A perso n in this stat e think s wit h mountin g excitemen t tha t h e ha s graspe d a n d solve d th e grea t cosmi c riddles; h e there - fore loses all touc h wit h huma n reality . A re - liabl e sympto m of this conditio n is th e loss of one's sens e of humo r an d of huma n contacts. Thu s th e emergin g of th e Self ma y brin g grea t dange r to a man's consciou s ego . Th e doubl e aspec t of th e Self is beautifull y illustra - ted b y this old Irania n fairy tale , calle d "Th e Secre t of th e Bat h Badgerd" : T h e grea t an d nobl e Princ e Hatim Ta i receives orders from his king to investigate the mysterious Bath Badgerd [castle of nonexistence]. Whe n he approache s it, havin g gone throug h man y dangerous adventures, he hears tha t nobod y ever returne d from it, bu t he insists on going on. He is received at a roun d buildin g by a barbe r with a mirro r wh o leads him into the bath , but as soon as the princ e enters the water, a thunderou s noise breaks out. it gets completely dark, the barbe r disappears, an d slowly the wate r begins to rise. Hatim swims desperately roun d until the wate r finally reaches the to p of the roun d cupola , which forms the roof of the bath . Now he fears he is lost, but he says a praye r an d grab s the centerstone of the cupola . Again a thunderou s noise, everything changes, an d Hatim stands alone in a desert. After long an d painful wandering , he come s to a beautiful garde n in the middl e of which is a circle of stone statues. In the cente r of the statues, he sees a parro t in its cage , an d a voice from above says to him : "Oh , hero, you probabl y will not escape alive from this bath . Onc e Gayomart [the First Man ] found an enormou s diamon d that shone mor e brightly tha n sun an d moon . He decided to hide it wher e no on e can find it, and therefore he built this magica l bat h in orde r to protect it. Th e parro t tha t you see her e forms part of the magic . At its feet lie a golden bow an d arrow on a golden chain , an d with them you m a y try thre e times to shoot the parrot. If you hit him the curse will be lifted; if not, you will be petrified, as wer e all these othe r people. " Hatim tries once , an d fails. His legs turn to stone. H e fails onc e mor e an d is petrified u p to his chest. Th e third time he just shuts his eyes, exclaiming "Go d is great, " shoots blindly, an d this time hits the parrot. An outbrea k of thun - der, clouds of dust. Whe n all this has subsided, in place of the parro t is an enormous, beautiful dia - mond , an d all the statue s hav e come to life again . T h e people than k him for their redemption . T h e reade r will recogniz e th e symbols of th e Self in this story - th e First Ma n Gayomart , th e roun d mandala-shape d building , th e center - stone , an d th e diamond . Bu t this diamon d is surrounde d b y danger . Th e demoni c parro t signifies th e evil spirit of imitatio n tha t make s o n e miss th e targe t an d petrify psychologically . As I pointe d ou t earlier, th e process of individuatio n exclude s an y parrot-lik e imitatio n of others. Tim e an d agai n in all countrie s peopl e hav e trie d t o cop y in "outer " o r ritualisti c be - havio r th e origina l religiou s experienc e of their grea t religiou s teachers Christ o r Buddh a o r som e othe r maste r —an d hav e therefor e becom e "petrified. " T o follow in th e step s of a grea t spiritua l leade r doe s no t mea n tha t on e shoul d cop y an d ac t ou t th e patter n of th e individua - tio n process mad e b y his life. It mean s tha t w e shoul d try wit h a sincerit y an d devotio n equa l to his to live ou r ow n lives. T h e barbe r wit h th e mirror , wh o vanishes, symbolize s th e gift of reflectio n tha t Hati m loses whe n h e wants it most ; th e risin g waters represen t th e risk tha t on e ma y drow n in th e unconsciou s an d ge t lost in one's ow n emotions. I n orde r to understan d th e symboli c indication s of th e unconscious, on e must b e carefu l no t t o ge t outsid e oneself o r "besid e oneself, " bu t t o sta y emotionall y withi n oneself. Indeed , it is vitall y importan t tha t th e eg o shoul d continu e to functio n in norma l ways. Onl y if I remai n a n ordinar y huma n being , consciou s of m y in - completeness, ca n I becom e receptiv e to th e significan t contents an d processe s of th e uncon - scious. Bu t ho w ca n a huma n bein g stan d th e tensio n ol feeling himself a t on e wit h th e whol e universe , whil e a t th e sam e tim e h e is onl y a miserabl e earthl y huma n creature ? If, o n th e o n e hand , I despis e myself as merel y a statistica l cipher, m y life ha s n o meanin g an d is no t wort h living . Bu t if, o n th e othe r hand , I feel myself to b e part of somethin g muc h greater, ho w a m I to kee p m y feet o n th e ground ? It is ver y difficult indee d to kee p thes e inne r opposite s unite d withi n oneself withou t topplin g ove r int o o n e o r th e othe r extreme . Far left, the torrential water s of the river Heraclitos overwhel m a Greek temple, in a painting by the moder n French artist Andr e Masson The painting can be seen as an allegory of the results of imbalance: Greek overemphasi s on logic and reason (the temple ) leading to a destructive eruptio n of instinctual forces Left, a more direct allegory, fro m a 15th-centur y illustration to the French allegorical poe m Le Roman de la Rose: the figure of Logic (on the right) is throw n into confusio n whe n confronte d by Nature Right, the repentant St Mar y Magdale n gazes into a mirror (in a painting by the 1 7th-centur y French artist Georges de la Tour) Here, as in the tale of the Bath Badgerd, the mirror symbolizes the much-neede d faculty of true, inward-lookin g "reflection," The social aspect of the Self Toda y th e enormou s growt h of population , especiall y obviou s in larg e cities, inevitabl y ha s a depressin g effect o n us.

Ther e ar e far to o man y peopl e in an y case. " An d whe n w e rea d in th e pape r abou t th e death s of innumerabl e unknow n peopl e wh o personall y mea n nothin g to us, th e feelin g tha t o u r lives coun t for nothin g is furthe r increased .

This is partl y wh y th e obligatio n attache d to th e process of individuatio n is often felt to b e a burde n rathe r tha n a n immediat e blessing . St. Christopher , th e patro n o f all travelers, is a fitting symbo l for this experience .

This miraculou s chil d is a symbo l of th e Self tha t literall y "depresses " th e ordinar y huma n being , eve n thoug h it is th e onl y thin g tha t ca n redee m him .

Tha t is wh y it is sometime s sai d tha t attendin g to th e unconsciou s make s peopl e antisocia l an d egocentric . As a rul e this is no t true , for ther e is a little-know n facto r tha t enters int o this attitude : th e collectiv e (or, w e coul d eve n say , social) aspec t of th e Self. Above, a page from Willia m Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience, in whic h the poem s reveal Blake's concept of the "divin e child"— a well-know n symbo l of the Self.

But, as is the case with all inne r processes, it is ultimately the Self tha t orders and regulates one's huma n relationships, so long as the conscious ego lakes the trouble to detect the delusive projections and deals with these inside himself instead of outside. It is in this way that spiritually attuned and similarly oriented people find their way to one another, to create a grou p tha t cuts across all the usual social and organizationa l affiliations of people. Such a grou p is not in conflict with others; it is merely different and independent. Th e consciously realized process of individuation thus change s a person's relationships. Th e familiar bonds such as kinship or commo n interests ar e replaced by a different type of unity — a bond through the Self. All activities and obligations tha t belong exclusively to the oute r world do definite harm to the secret activities of the unconscious. Throug h these unconscious ties those wh o belong together come together. Tha t is one reason why attempts to influence people by advertisements and political propagand a ar e destructive, even when inspired by idealistic motives. This raises the importan t question of whethe r the unconscious part of the huma n psyche can be influenced at all. Practical experience and accurat e observation show tha t one cannot influence one's own dreams. Ther e are people, it is true, who assert tha t they can influence them. But if you look into their dream material, you find that they d o only wha t I do with my disobedient dog ; I orde r him to do those things I notice he wants to do anyhow, so tha t I can preserve my illusion of authority. Onl y a long process of interpreting one's dreams and confronting oneself with wha t they have to say can gradually transform the unconscious. And conscious attitude s also must change in this process. If a ma n who wants to influence public opinion misuses symbols for this purpose, they will naturally impress the masses in so far as they are true symbols, but whethe r or not the mass unconscious will be emotionally gripped by them is something that cannot be calculated in advance , something that remains completely irrational. No music publisher, for instance, can tell in advanc e whethe r a song will become a hit or not, even though it may draw on popula r images and melodies. No deliberat e attempts to influence the unconscious have yet produced any significant results, and it seems tha t the mass unconscious preserves its autonomy just as much as the individual unconscious. 2 2 I At times, in orde r to express its purposes, the unconscious may use a motif from our external world an d thus ma y seem to have been influenced by it. For instance, I have come across man y dreams of modern people tha t have to d o with Berlin. In these dreams Berlin stands as a symbol of the psychic weak spot—the place of danger—an d for this reason is the place wher e the Self is apt to appear. It is the point wher e the dreame r is torn by conflict and wher e he might, therefore, be able to unit e the inner opposites. I have also encountered an extraordinary numbe r of dream reactions to the film Hiroshima Mon Amour. In most of these dreams the idea was expressed tha t either the two lovers in the film must unit e (which symbolizes the union of inne r opposites) or there would be an atomi c explosion (a symbol of complete dissociation, equivalent to madness). Onl y whe n the manipulators of public opinion add commercia l pressure or acts of violence to their activities do they seem to achieve a temporar y success. But in fact this merely causes a repression of the genuine unconscious reactions. An d mass repression leads to the same result as individua l repression; that is, to neurotic dissociation an d psychological illness. All such attempts to repress the reactions of the unconscious must fail in the long run, for they are basically opposed to our instincts. We know from studying the social behavior of the higher animals tha t small groups (from approximatel y 10 to 50 individuals) create the As in the dream quote d on p. 223 , positive anima figures often assist and guid e men . To p of page, from a 10th-centur y psalter, David inspired by the muse. Above , a goddes s saves a shipwrecke d sailor (in a 1 6th - centur y painting).

His physical well-being, his spiritual psychic health, and , beyond the anima l realm, his cultural efficiency seem to flourish best in such a social function. As far as we at present understan d the process of individuation, the Self apparentl y tends to produc e such small groups by creating at the same time sharply defined ties of feeling between certain individuals and feelings of relatedness to all people. Only if these connections are created by the Self can one feel any assurance tha t envy, jealousy, fighting, and all man - ner of negative projections will not break u p the group. Thu s an unconditiona l devotion to one's own process of individuation also brings abou t the best possible adaptation . This does not mean , of course, tha t there will not be collisions of opinion an d conflicting obligations, or disagreement abou t the "right " way. in the face of which one must constantly withdraw and listen to one's inne r voice in orde r to find the individual standpoint tha t the Self intends one to have . Fanatica l political activity (but not the performance of essential duties) seems somehowincompatibl e with individuation. A ma n wh o devoted himself entirely to freeing his country from foreign occupation had this dream : With some of my compatriots I go up a stairway to the attic of a museum, where there is a hall painted black and looking like a cabin on a ship. A distinguished-looking middle-aged lady opens the door; her name is X, daughter of X. [X was a famous national hero of the dreamer's country who attempted some centuries ago to free it. He might be compared to Joan of Arc or William Tell. In reality X had no children.] In the hall we see the portraits of two aristocratic ladies dressed in flowery brocaded garments. While Miss X is explaining these pictures to us, they suddenly come to life; first the eyes begin to live, and then the chest seems to breathe. People are surprised and go to a lecture room where Miss X will speak to them about the phenomenon. She says that through her intuition and feeling these portraits came alive; but some of the people are indignant and say that Miss X is mad; some even leave the lecture room. T h e importan t feature of this dream is tha t the anima figure, Miss X, is purely a creation of the dream. She has, however, the name of a famous nationa l hero-liberator (as if she were, for instance. Wilhelmina Tell, the daughte r of William Tell). By the implications contained in the name , the unconscious is pointing to the fact tha t today the dreame r should not try, as X did long ago, to free his country in an oute r way. Now, the dream says, liberation is accomplished by the anima (by the dreamer's soul), w h o accomplishes it by bringing the images of the unconscious to life. Tha t the hall in the attic of the museum looks partly like a ship's cabin painted black is very meaningful. Th e black color hints at darkness, night, a turning inward , an d if the hall is 223 a cabin, then the museum is somehow also a ship. This suggests tha t whe n the mainlan d of collective consciousness becomes flooded by unconsciousness an d barbarism, this museum-ship, filled with living images, ma y turn into a saving ark tha t will carry those wh o enter it to anothe r spiritual shore. Portraits hangin g in a museum are usually the dea d remains of the past, an d often the images of the unconscious ar e regarded in the same way until we discover tha t they are alive an d meaningful. Whe n the anima (who appears here in her rightful role of soulguide) contemplate s the images with intuition and feeling, they begin to live. T h e indignan t people in the dream represent the side of the dreame r tha t is influenced by collective opinion—somethin g in him tha t distrusts and rejects the bringing to life of psychic images. The y personify a resistance to the unconscious tha t might express itself something like this: "But wha t if they begin droppin g atom bombs on us? Psychological insight won't be muc h help then! " This resistant side is unabl e to free itself from statistical thinking an d from extraverted rational prejudices. Th e dream, however, points out tha t in our time genuine liberation can start only with a psychological transformation. T o wha t end does one liberate one's country if afterward there is no meaningful goal of life - no .goal for which it is worthwhil e to be free? If ma n no longer finds any meanin g in his life, it makes no difference whethe r he wastes awa y unde r a Communist or a capitalist regime. Onl y if he can use his freedom to create something meaningful is it relevant tha t he should be free. Tha t is why finding the inner meanin g of life is mor e importan t to the individua l than anything else, an d why the process of individuation must be given priority. Attempts to influence public opinion by means of newspapers, radio, television, and advertising are based on two factors. O n the one hand , they rely on sampling technique s tha t reveal the trend of "opinion " or "wants" - -tha t is, of collective attitudes. O n the other, they express prejudices, projections, an d unconscious complexes (mainly the powe r complex) of those wh o manipulat e public opinion. But statistics do no justice to the individual. Although the average size of stones in a heap m a y be five centimeters, one will find very few stones of exactly this size in the heap. Tha t the second factor cannot create anything positive is clear from the start. But if a single individua l devotes himself to individua - tion, he frequently has a positive contagious effect on the people aroun d him. It is as if a spark leaps from one to another. An d this usually occurs whe n one has no intention of influencing others an d often when one uses no words. It is onto this inne r pat h tha t Miss X tried to lead the dreamer. Nearly all religious systems on our plane t contain images tha t symbolize the process of individuation, or at least some stages of it. In Christian countries the Self is projected, as I said before, onto the second Adam : Christ. In the East the relevant figures are those of Krishn a an d Buddha . For people who are contained in a religion (that is, who still really believe in its content a n d teachings), the psychological regulation of their lives is effected by religious symbols, an d even their dreams often revolve aroun d them. Whe n the late Pope Pius XI I issued the declaration of the Assumption of Mary , a Catholic woma n dreamed , for instance, tha t she was a Catholi c priestess. He r unconscious seemed to extend the dogma in this way : "If Mar y is now almost a goddess, she should have priestesses." Anothe r Catholi c woman , who ha d resistances to some of the minor an d outer aspects of her creed, dreame d tha t the churc h of her home city ha d been pulled down and rebuilt, but tha t the tabernacl e with the consecrated host and the statue of the Virgin Mar y were to be transferred from the old to the new church. Th e dream showed her tha t some of the man-mad e aspects of her religion needed renewal, but tha t its basic symbols — Cod's having become Man , and the Grea t Mother, the Virgin Mary— would survive the change . Such dreams demonstrat e the living interest tha t the unconscious takes in the conscious religious representations of an individual. This 224 raises the question whethe r it is possible to detect a general trend in all the religious dreams of contemporar y people. In the manifestations of the unconscious found in our moder n Christian culture , whethe r Protestant or Catholic , Dr. Jun g often observed tha t there is an unconscious tendency at work to round off our trinitarian formula of the Godhea d with a fourth element, which tends to be feminine, dark, and even evil. Actually this fourth element has always existed in the realm of our religious representations, but it was separated from the image of God an d became his counterpart, in the form of matte r itself (or the lord of matte r —i.e. the devil). Now the unconscious seems to wan t to reunit e these extremes, the light having become too bright and the darkness too somber. Naturally it is the central symbol of religion, the image of the Godhead , that is most exposed to unconscious tendencies toward transformation. A Tibeta n abbo t once told Dr. Jun g tha t the most impressive mandala s in Tibe t are built up by imagination, or directed fantasy, when the psychological balanc e of the grou p is disturbed or when a particula r thought cannot be rendered because it is not yet contained 1n the sacred doctrine an d must therefore be searched for. In these remarks, two equally importan t basic aspects of mandal a symbolism emerge . T h e mandal a serves a conservative purpose - namely, to restore a previously existing order. But it also serves the creative purpos e of giving expression and form to something tha t does not yet exist, something new and unique . Th e second aspect is perhap s even mor e importan t than the first, but does not contradic t it. For, in most cases, wha t restores the old orde r simultaneously involves some element of new creation. In the new orde r the older patter n returns on a higher level. Th e process is tha t of the ascending spiral, which grows upwar d while simultaneously returning again an d again to the same point. A painting by a simple woma n who was brought up in Protestant surroundings shows a mandal a in the form of a spiral. In a dream this woma n received an orde r to paint the Godhead. Late r (also in a dream) she saw it in a book. Of God himself she saw only his wafting cloak, the draper y of which mad e a beautiful display of light and shadow. This contrasted impressively with the stability of the spiral in the deep blue sky. Fascinated by the cloak and the .spiral, the dreame r did not look closely at the othe r figure on the rocks. Whe n she awoke and thought abou t wh o these divine figures were, she suddenly realized tha t it was "Go d himself." This gave her a frightful shock, which she felt for a long time. Usually the Holy Ghost is represented in Christian art by a fiery wheel or a dove, but here it has appeare d as a spiral. This is a new thought, "no t yet contained in the doctrine, " This 1 5th-centur y statue of Mar y contains withi n it images of bot h G o d and Christ— a clear expression of the fact that the Virgin Mar y can be said to be a representation of the "Great Mother " archetype 225 A miniature fro m the 1 5th-centur y French Book of Hours, showin g Mar y wit h the Hol y Trinity. The Catholi c Church' s dogm a of the Assumptio n of the Virgin — in whic h Mary , as domina rerum. Quee n of Nature, wa s declared to have entered heaven wit h soul and bod y reunited—ca n be said t o have made the Trinity fourfold , correspondin g wit h the basic archetype of completenes s which has spontaneously arisen from the unconscious. Tha t the Holy Ghost is the powe r tha t works for the further development of our religious understandin g is not a new idea, of course, but its symbolic representation in the form of a spiral is new. T h e same woma n then painted a second picture, also inspired by a dream, showing the dreame r with her positive animu s standing above Jerusalem whe n the wing of Satan descends to darke n the city. The satanic wing strongly reminded her of the wafting cloak of God in the first painting, but in the former dream the spectator is high up, somewher e in heaven, and sees in front of her a terrific split between the rocks. Th e movemen t in the cloak of God is an attemp t to reach Christ, the figure on the right, but it does not quit e succeed. In the second painting, the same thing is seen from below from a huma n angle. Looking at it from a higher angle, wha t is moving and spreading is a part of God ; above that rises the spiral as a symbol of possible further development. But seen from the basis of our huma n reality, this same thing in the air is the dark, uncann y wing of the devil. In the dreamer's life these two pictures became real in a way that does not concern us here, but it is obvious tha t they also contain a collective meanin g tha t reaches beyond the personal. The y ma y prophesy the descent of a divine darkness upon the Christian hemisphere , a darkness tha t points, however, toward the possibility of further evolution. Since the axis of the spiral does not move upwar d but into the backgroun d of the picture, the further evolution will lead neither to greate r spiritual height nor down into the realm of matter, but to anothe r dimension, probably into the backgroun d of these divine figures. And that means into the unconscious. Whe n religious symbols that are partly different from those we know emerge from the unconscious of an individual, it is often feared tha t these will wrongfully alter or diminish the officially recognized religious symbols. This fear even causes man y people to reject analytical psychology and the entire unconscious. 226 II I look at such a resistance from a psychological point of view, I should have to comment tha t as far as religion is concerned, huma n beings can be divided into three types. First, ther e are those wh o still genuinely believe their religious doctrines, whateve r they may be. For these people, the symbols an d doctrines "click" so satisfyingly with wha t they feel deep inside themselves tha t serious doubts have no chanc e to sneak in. This happen s when the views of consciousness an d the unconscious background are in relative harmony . People of this sort can afford to look at new psychological discoveries an d facts without prejudice and need not fear tha t they ma y be caused to lose their faith. Even if their dreams should bring u p some relatively unorthodo x details, these can be integrated into their general view. T h e second type consists of those people who have completely lost their faith and have replaced it with purely conscious, rational opinions. For these people, dept h psychology simply means an introduction into newly discovered areas of the psyche, and it should cause no trouble when they embar k on the new adventure and investigate their dreams to test the truth of them. The n there is a third grou p of people wh o in one part of themselves (probably the head) no longer believe in their religious traditions, wherea s in some othe r part they still do believe. The French philosopher Voltaire is an illustration of this. He violently attacked the Catholic Churc h with rational argumen t (ecrasez I'infdme), but on his deathbed , according to some reports, he begged for extreme unction. Whethe r this is true or not, his head was certainly unreligious, wherea s his feelings and emotions seem still to have been orthodox. Such people remind one of a person getting stuck in the automati c doors of a bus; he can neither get out into free space nor re-enter the bus. Of course the dreams of such persons could probably help them out of their dilemma , but such people frequently have trouble turning toward the unconscious because they themselves do not know wha t they think and want. T o take the unconscious seriously is ultimately a matte r of personal courage and integrity. T h e complicated situation of those wh o ar e caught in a no-man's-land between the two states of mind is partly created by the fact that all official religious doctrines actually belong to the collective consciousness (what Freud called the super-ego); but once, long ago, they sprang from the unconscious. This is a point that man y historians of religion and theologians challenge. The y choose to assume that there was once some sort of "revelation. " I have searched for man y years for concrete evidence for the Jun - Paintings of the dreams discussed on pp. 225-6 : Left, the spiral (a form of mandala ) represents the Hol y Ghost; right, the dark win g of Satan, from the second dream Neither motif woul d be a familiar religious symbo l to most people (nor wer e they t o the dreamer): Each emerged spontaneousl y from the unconscious . gian hypothesis abou t this problem; but it has been difficult to find because most rituals are so old tha t one canno t trace their origin. Th e following example , however, seems to me to offer a most importan t clue : Black Elk, a medicine ma n of the Oglal a Sioux, who died not long ago, tells us in his autobiograph y Black Elk Speaks that, whe n he was nine years old, he became seriously ill an d durin g a sort of coma ha d a tremendou s vision. He saw four groups of beautiful horses coming from the four corners of the world, an d then, seated within a cloud, he saw the Six Grand - fathers, the ancestral spirits of his tribe, "th e grandfathers of the whole world. " The y gave him six healing symbols for his people and showed him new ways of life. But whe n he was 16 years old, he suddenly developed a terrible phobi a wheneve r a thunde r storm was ap - proaching, because he hear d "thunde r beings " calling to him "t o mak e haste. " It reminde d him of the thunderin g noise mad e by the ap - proachin g horses in his vision. An old medicine m a n explained to him tha t his fear came from the fact tha t he was keeping his vision to himself, and said tha t he must tell it to his tribe. H e did so, and later he and his people acted out the vision in a ritual, using real horses. Not merely Black Elk himself, but man y othe r members of his tribe felt infinitely better after this play. Some were even cured of their diseases. Black Elk said: "Eve n the horses seemed to be healthier and happie r after the dance. " T h e ritual was not repeated because the tribe was destroyed soon afterward. But here is a different case in which a ritual still survives. Several Eskimo tribes living nea r the Colville River in Alaska explain the origin of their eagle festival in the following way : A young hunter shot dead a very unusual eagle and was so impressed by the beauty of the dead bird that he stuffed and made a fetish of him, honoring him by sacrifices. One day, when the hunter had traveled far inland during his hunting, two animal-men suddenly appeared in the role of messengers and led him to the land of the eagles. There he heard a dark drumming noise, and the messengers explained that this was the heartbeat of the dead eagle's mother. Then the eagle spirit appeared to the hunter as a woman clothed in black. She asked him to initiate an eagle festival among his people to honor her dead son. After the eagle people had shown him how to do this, he suddenly found himself, exhausted, back in the place where he had met the messengers. Returning home, he taught his people how to perform the great eagle festival—as they have done faithfully ever since. From such example s we see how a ritual or religious custom can spring directly from an unconscious revelation experienced by a single individual. Ou t of such beginnings, people living in cultura l groups develop their various religious activities with their enormous influence on the entire life of the society. Durin g a long process of evolution the original materia l is shaped and reshaped by words an d actions, is beautified, an d acquires increasingly definite forms. This crystallizing process, however, has a grea t disadvantage . Mor e an d mor e people have no personal knowledge of the original experience an d can only believe wha t their elders a n d teachers tell them abou t it. The y no longer know tha t such happenings are real, an d they are of course ignorant abou t how one feels during the experience. In their present forms, worked over an d exceedingly aged, such religious traditions often resist further creative alterations by the unconscious. Theologians sometimes even defend these "true " religious symbols an d symbolic doctrines against the discovery of a religious function in the unconscious psyche, forgetting tha t the values they fight for owe their existence to tha t very same function. Withou t a huma n psyche to receive divine inspirations and utter them in words or shape them in art, no religious symbol has ever come into the reality of our huma n life. (We need only think of the prophets an d the evangelists.) If someone objects tha t there is a religious reality in itself, independen t of the huma n psyche, I can only answer such a person with this question: "Wh o says this, if not a huma n psyche? " No matte r wha t we assert, we can 2 2Q never get awa y from the existence of the psyche —for we ar e containe d within it, an d it is the only mean s by which we can grasp reality. Thu s the moder n discovery of the uncon - scious shuts one doo r forever. It definitely excludes the illusory idea, so favored by some individuals, tha t a ma n ca n know spiritual reality in itself. In moder n physics, too, a door has been closed by Heisenberg's "principl e of indeterminacy, " shutting out the delusion tha t we can comprehen d a n absolut e physical reality. Th e discovery of the unconscious, however, compensate s for the loss of these beloved illusions by openin g before us an immens e an d unexplored new field of realizations, within which objective scientific investigation combines in a strange new way with personal ethical adventure . But, as I said at the outset, it is practically impossible to impart the whol e reality of one's experience in the new field. Muc h is uniqu e and can be only partially communicate d by language . Here , too, a doo r is shut against the illusion tha t one can completely understan d anothe r person an d tell him wha t is right for him. Onc e again, however, one can find a compensation for this in the new realm of experience by the discovery of the social function of the Self, which works in a hidden way to unite separat e individuals who belong together. Intellectua l chit-cha t is thus replaced bymeaningful events tha t occur in the reality of the psyche. Hence , for the individual to enter seriously into the process of individuation in the way tha t has been outlined means a completely new an d different orientation toward life. For scientists it also mean s a new an d different scientific approac h to oute r facts. Ho w this will work out in the field of huma n knowledge an d in the social life of huma n beings canno t be predicted. But to me it seems certain tha t Jung's discovery of the process of individuation is a fact tha t future generations will have to take into accoun t if they wan t to avoid drifting into a stagnan t or even regressive outlook.

In fact, the whol e cosmos is a potentia l symbol. Man , with his symbol-makin g propensity, unconsciously transforms objects or forms into symbols (thereby endowin g them with grea t psychological importance ) an d expresses them in both his religion an d his visual art. Th e intertwined history of religion an d art, reachin g back to prehistoric times, is the record tha t our ancestors have left of the symbols tha t wer e mean - ingful an d movin g to them. Eve n today, as moder n paintin g an d sculptur e show, the interplay of religion an d art is still alive. For the first part of my discussion of symbolism in the visual arts, I intend to examin e some of the specific motifs tha t have been universally sacred or mysterious to man . Then , for the remainde r of the chapter, I wish to discuss the phenomeno n of 20th-centur y art, not in terms of its use of symbols, but in terms of its significance as a symbol itself—a symbolic expression of the psychological condition of the moder n world. In the following pages, I hav e chosen thre e recurrin g motifs with which to illustrate the presence an d natur e of symbolism in the art of man y different periods. Thes e ar e the symbols of the stone, the animal, an d the circle—each of which has ha d endurin g psychological significance from the earliest expressions of huma n consciousness to the most sophisticated forms of 20th-century art. W e know tha t even unhew n stones ha d a highly symbolic meanin g for ancient an d primitive societies. Rough , natura l stones wer e often believed to be the dwelling places of spirits or gods, an d wer e used in primitive culture s as 232 Symbolism in the visual arts tombstones, boundar y stones, or objects of religious veneration. Their use ma y be regarde d as a primeva l form of sculptur e a first attemp t to invest the stone with mor e expressive powe r than chanc e an d natur e could give it. T h e Ol d Testamen t story of Jacob's dream is a typical exampl e of how, thousands of years ago, ma n felt tha t a living god or a divine spirit was embodie d in the stone an d how the stone became a symbol: And Jacob . . . went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of the place, and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven, and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Beth-el. For Jacob , the stone was an integral part of the revelation. It was the mediato r between himself a n d God . In man y primitive stone-sanctuaries, the deity is represented not by a single stone bu t by a grea t man y unhew n stones, arrange d in distinct patterns. (Th e geometrica l stone alignments in Brittany an d the stone circle at Stonehenge ar e famous examples.) Arrangements of rough natura l stones also play a considerabl e part in the highly civilized rock garden s of Zen Buddhism. Their arrangemen t is not geometrical but seems to have come abou t by pur e chance . In fact, however, it is the expression of a most refined spirituality. Ver y early in history, me n bega n trying to express wha t they felt to be the soul or spirit of a rock by working it into a recognizabl e form. In man y cases, the form was a mor e or less de - finite approximatio n to the huma n figure—for instance, the ancient menhirs with their crud e outlines of faces, or the herms tha t developed out of boundar y stones in ancient Greece , or the Abov e left, the stone alignment s at Carnac in Brittany , datin g fro m c. 200 0 B.C.—crud e stones set upright in row s that are though t to have been used in sacred rituals and religious processions. Left, rough stones resting o n raked sand in a Zen Buddhis t rock garden (in the Ryoanj i temple, Japan). Thoug h apparently haphazard, the stones ' arrangement in fact expresses a highly refined spirituality. Right, a prehistoric menhir—a rock that has been slightl y carved into a female for m (probabl y a mother goddess). Far right, a sculpture by Ma x Ernst (bor n 1891 ) has also hardly altered the natural shape of the stone. man y primitive stone idols with huma n features. T h e animatio n of the stone must be explained as the projection of a mor e or less distinct content of the unconscious into the stone. T h e primitive tendency to give merely a hint of a huma n figure, an d to retain muc h of the stone's natura l form, can also be seen in moder n sculpture . Man y example s show the artists" concern with the "self-expression" of 'tinstone ; to use the language of myth, the stone is allowed to "speak for itself." This can be seen, for instance, in the work of the Swiss sculptor Han s Aeschbacher, the America n sculptor James Rosati, an d the German-bor n artist Ma x Ernst. In a letter from Maloj a in 1935, Ernst wrote : "Albert o [the Swiss artist Giacometti] and I are afflicted with sculpturitis. We work on granite boulders, large an d small, from the moraine of the Forn o glacier. Wonderfully polished by time, frost, an d weather, they are in themselves fantastically beautiful. No huma n han d can do that. So why not leave the spade - work to the elements, an d confine ourselves to scratching on them the runes of our own mystery? " Wha t Ernst mean t by "mystery " is not explained. But later in this chapte r I shall try to show tha t the "mysteries " of the moder n artist are not very different from those of the old masters wh o knew the "spirit of the stone. " T h e emphasis on this "spirit " in much sculp - ture is one indication of the shifting, indefinable borderline between religion and art. Sometimes one cannot be separated from the other. The same ambivalenc e can also be seen in anothe r symbolic motif, as it appears in age-old works of art : the symbol of the animal. Anima l pictures go back to the last Ice Age (between 60,000 and 10,000 B.C.) . The y were discovered on the walls of caves in Franc e a n d Spain at the end of the last century, but it was not until early in the present century that archaeologists began to realize their extreme importanc e an d to inquir e into their meaning. These inquiries revealed an infinitely remote prehistoric cultur e whose existence had never even been suspected. Even today, a strange music seems to haun t the caves that contain the rock engravings and paintings. According to the Germa n art historian Herbert Kiihn, inhabitants of the areas in Africa, Spain, France , and Scandinavi a wher e such paintings are found could not be induced to go nea r the caves. A kind of religious awe, or perhaps a fear of spirits hovering amon g the rocks and the paintings, held them back. Passing nomad s still lay their votive offerings before the old rock paintings in North Africa. In the 15thcentury. Pope Calixtus 11 prohibited religious ceremonies in the "cav e with the horsepictures. " Whic h cave the pope mean t is not known, but there can be no doub t tha t it was a cave of the Ice Age containing anima l pictures. All this goes to prove that the caves an d rocks 234 Far left, animal paintings o n cave wall s at Lascaux The paintings were not simply decorative; they had a magical function . Left, a drawin g of a bison covered wit h arrow and spear marks: The cave dweller s believed that by ritually "killing " the image, they woul d be more likely to kill the animal.

Right, a statue of Stalin destroyed by Hungarian rebels in 1956; far right, rebels hang a bust of the former Stalinist Hungarian premier Matya s Rakosi. with the anima l paintings have always been instinctively felt to be wha t they originally were —religious places. Th e numen of the place has outlived the centuries. In a numbe r of caves the moder n visitor must travel through low, dark, and dam p passages till he reaches the point wher e the great painted "chambers " suddenly open out. This arduous approac h ma y express the desire of the primitive men to safeguard from commo n sight all tha t was contained and went on in the caves, and to protect their mystery. Th e sudden and unexpected sight of the paintings in the chambers, coming after the difficult an d awe-inspiring approach , must have mad e an overwhelming impression on primitive man . T h e paleolithic cave paintings consist almost entirely of figures of animals, whose movements and postures have been observed in natur e an d rendered with great artistic skill. Ther e are, however, man y details tha t show tha t the figures were intended to be something mor e than naturalistic reproductions. Kiihn writes: "Th e strange thing is tha t a good man y primitive paintings have been used as targets. At Monte - span ther e is an engraving of a horse tha t is being driven into a trap ; it is pitted with the marks of missiles. A clay model of a bea r in the same cave has 42 holes. " These pictures suggest a hunting-magi c like that still practiced today by huntin g tribes in Africa. Th e painted anima l has the function of a "double" ; by its symbolic slaughter, the hunters attemp t to anticipat e an d ensure the death of the real animal. This is a form of sympatheti c magic, which is based on the "reality " of a doubl e represented in a picture : Wha t happens to the pictur e will happe n to the original. Th e underlying psychological fact is a strong identification between a living being and its image , which is considered to be the being's soul. (This is one reason why a great man y primitive people today will shrink from being photographed.) Othe r cave pictures must have served magic fertility rites. The y show animals at the momen t of mating ; an exampl e can be seen in the figures of a mal e and female bison in the T u c d'Audubert cave in France . Thu s the realistic picture of the animals was enriched by overtones of magic and took on a symbolic significance. It became the image of the living essence of the animal. T h e most interesting figures in the cave paintings ar e those of semihuma n beings in anima l disguise, which ar e sometimes to be found besides the animals. In the Trois Freres cave in France , a ma n wrappe d in an anima l hide is playing a primitive flute as if he meant to put a spell on the animals. In the same cave, there is a dancin g huma n being, with antlers, a horse's head, and bear's paws. This figure, dominating a medley of several hundre d animals, is unquestionably the "Lor d of the Animals. " 235 T h e customs an d usages of some primitive African tribes today can throw some light on the meanin g of these mysterious an d doubtless symbolic figures. In initiations, secret societies, and even the institution of monarch y in these tribes, animals an d anima l disguises often play an importan t part. Th e king and chief are animals too—generally lions or leopards. Vestiges of this custom ma y be discerned in the title of the last emperor of Ethiopia , Haile Selassie (Lion of Judah) , or the honorific name of Dr. Hastings Banda (The Lion of Malawi). The further back we go in time, or the mor e primitive and close to natur e the society is, the mor e literally such titles must be taken. A primitive chief is not only disguised as the animal ; when he appears at initiation rites in full anima l disguise, he is the animal. Still more , he is an anima l spirit, a terrifying demo n wh o performs circumcision. At such moments he incorporates or represents the ancestor of the tribe and the clan, an d therefore the prima l god himself. He represents, and is, the "totem " animal. Thu s we probabl y should not go far wrong in seeing in the figure of the dancin g animal-ma n in the Trois Freres cave a kind of chief who has been transformed by his disguise into an anima l demon . In the course of time, the complet e anima l disguise was superseded in man y places by animal and demo n masks. Primitive men lavished all their artistic skill on these masks, and man y of them are still unsurpassed in the powe r and intensity of their expression. The y ar e often the objects of the same veneration as the god or demo n himself. Anima l masks play a part in the folk arts of man y moder n countries, like Switzerland, or in the magnificently expressive masks of the ancient Japanes e No drama , which is still performed in moder n Japan . Th e symbolic function of the mask is the same as tha t of the original anima l disguise. Individua l huma n expression is submerged, but in its place the weare r assumes the dignity and the beauty (and also the horrifying expression) of an anima l demon . In psychological terms, the mask transforms its weare r into an archetypa l image . Dancing, which was originally nothing mor e than a completion of the anima l disguise by appropriat e movements and gestures, was probably supplementar y to the initiation or other rites. It was, so to speak, performed by demons in honor of a demon . In the soft clay of the Tu c d'Audubert cave, Herbert Kiihn found footprints tha t led aroun d anima l figures. The y show that dancin g was part of even the Ice Age rites. "Onl y heel prints can be seen, " Kiihn writes. "Th e dancers had moved like bisons. The y had dance d a bison danc e for the fertility and increase of the animals and for their slaughter. " In his introductory chapter, Dr. Jun g has pointed out the close relation, or even identifiFar left, a prehistoric painting from Trois Freres cave includes (lowe r right corner) a huma n figure, perhaps a shaman, wit h horns and hoofs. As examples of "animal" dances : left, a Burmese buffalo dance in whic h masked dancer s are possessed by the buffalo spirit; right, a Bolivian devi l dance in whic h the dancer s wear demoni c animal masks; far right, an old southwes t German folk danc e in whic h the dancer s are disguised as witche s and as animal-like "wil d men, " 236 cation, between the native and his totem anima l (or "bush-soul"). Ther e ar e special ceremonies for the establishment of this relationship, especially the initiation rites for boys. Th e boy enters into possession of his "anima l soul, " an d at the same time sacrifices his own "anima l being " by circumcision. This dua l process admits him to the totem clan and establishes his relationship to his totem animal. Above all, he becomes a man , an d (in a still wide r sense) a huma n being. East Coast Africans described the uncircumcised as "animals. " The y had neither received ah anima l soul nor sacrificed their "animality. " In othe r words, since neithe r the huma n nor the anima l aspect of an uncircumcised boy's soul had become conscious, his anima l aspect was regarded as dominant . T h e anima l motif is usually symbolic of man's primitive and instinctual nature . Even civilized men must realize the violence of their instinctual drives and their powerlessness in face of the autonomou s emotions erupting from the unconscious. This is still mor e the case with primitive men, whose consciousness is not highly developed and who are still less well equipped to weathe r the emotiona l storm. In the first chapte r of this book, when Dr. Jun g is discussing the ways in which ma n developed the powe r of reflection, he takes an exampl e of an African who fell into a rage and killed his beloved little son. Whe n the ma n recovered himself, he was overwhelmed with grief and remorse for wha t he had done . In this case a negative impulse broke loose and did its deadly work regardless of the conscious will. Th e animal demo n is a highly expressive symbol for such an impulse. Th e vividness and concreteness of the image enables ma n to establish a relationship with it as a representative of the overwhelming powe r in himself. He fears it and seeks to propitiat e it by sacrifice an d ritual. A large numbe r of myths are concerned with a prima l animal, which must be sacrificed in the cause of fertility or even creation. On e exampl e of this is the sacrifice of a bull by the Persian sun-god Mithras, from which sprang the earth with all wealth and fruitfulness. In the Christian legend of St. George slaying the dragon , the primeva l rite of sacrificial slaughter again appears. In the religions and religious art of practically every race, anima l attribute s are ascribed to the supreme gods, or the gods are represented as animals. Th e ancient Babylonians translated their gods into the heavens in the shape of the Ram , the Bull, the Crab , the Lion, the Scorpion, the Fish, and so on — the signs of the Zodiac . Th e Egyptians represented the goddess Hatho r as cow-headed, the god Amo n as ram-headed , and Thot h as ibis-headed or in the shape of a baboon . Ganesha , the Hind u god of good fortune, has a huma n body but the head 237 of an elephant, Vishnu is a boar, Hanuma n is an ape-god, etc. (Th e Hindus, incidentally, do not assign the first place in the hierarchy of being to man : Th e elephant and lion stand higher.) Greek mythology is full of anima l symbolism. Zeus, the father of the gods, often approache s a girl whom he desires in the shape of a swan, a bull, or an eagle. In Germani c mythology, the cat is sacred to the goddess Freya, while the boar, the raven, and the horse are sacred to Wotan . Even in Christianity, anima l symbolism plays a surprisingly great part. Three of the Evange - lists have anima l emblems: St. Euke has the ox, St. Mar k the lion, an d St. Joh n the eagle. Only one , St. Matthew, is represented as a ma n or as an angel. Christ himself symbolically appears as the Lam b of Go d or the Fish, but he is also the serpent exalted on the cross, the lion, and in rare r cases the unicorn. Thes e anima l attribute s of Christ indicat e that even the Son of God (the supreme personification of man ) can no mor e dispense with his anima l natur e than with his higher, spiritual nature . Th e subhuma n as well as the superhuma n is felt to belong to the realm of the divine ; the relationship of these two aspects of ma n is beautifully symbolized in the Christma s pictur e of the birth of Christ, in a stable amon g animals. T h e boundless profusion of anima l symbolism in the religion an d art of all times does not 2 3 8 Left, a mask used in the ancient No dram a of Japan , in whic h the players often portray gods , spirits, or demons . Abov e right, masked performers in Japanese danc e theater Belo w right, an actor in Japan' s Kabuk i drama, dressed as a medieval hero, wit h mask-like make up merely emphasiz e the importanc e of the symbol ; it shows how vital it is for men to integrat e into their lives the symbol's psychic content — instinct. In itself, an anima l is neither good nor evil; it is a piece of nature . It canno t desire anythin g that is not in its nature . T o put this anothe r way, it obeys its instincts. Thes e instincts often seem mysterious to us, but they have their parallel in huma n life: Th e foundation of huma n natur e is instinct. But in man , the "anima l being " (which lives in him as his instinctual psyche) may become dangerous if it is not recognized and integrated in life. Ma n is the only creatur e with the powe r to control instinct by his own will, but he is also able to suppress, distort, and woun d it and an animal, tospeak metaphorically, is never so wild and dangerous as whe n it is wounded . Suppressed instincts can gain control of a man ; they can even destroy him. T h e familiar dream in which the dreame r is pursued by an anima l nearly always indicates tha t an instinct has been split off from consciousness and ought to be (or is trying to be) readmitted and integrated into life. Th e mor e dangerous the behavior of the anima l in the dream, the mor e unconscious is the primitive and instinctual soul of the dreamer, and the mor e imperative is its integration into his life if some irreparabl e evil is to be forestalled. Suppressed and wounde d instincts are the dangers threatening civilized man ; uninhibited drives are the dangers threatening primitive man . In both cases the "animal " is alienated from its true nature ; and for both, the acceptance of the anima l soul is the condition for wholeness and a fully lived life. Primitive ma n must tame the anima l in himself and mak e it his helpful companio n : civilized ma n must heal the anima l in himself and make it his friend. Othe r contributors to this book have discussed the importanc e of the stone and anima l motifs in terms of dream an d myth ; I have used them here only as general example s of the appearanc e of such living symbols throughou t the history of art (and especially religious art). Let us now examine in the same way a most powerful and universal symbol: the circle. Examples of animal symbol s of divinities from three religions: T o p of page, the H indu go d Ganesha (a painted sculpture from the Royal Palace of Nepal), go d of prudence and wisdom ; above, the Greek go d Zeus in the form of a swa n (wit h Leda); right, on opposite sides of a medieval coin , the crucified Christ show n as a ma n and as a serpent 239 The symbol of the circle Dr. M.-E. von Franz has explained the circle (or sphere) as a symbol of the Self. It expresses the totality of the psyche in all its aspects, including the relationship between ma n an d the whole of nature . Whethe r the symbol of the circle appears in primitive sun worship or modern religion, in myths or dreams, in the mandala s drawn by Tibeta n monks, in the ground plans of cities, or in the spherical concepts of early astronomers, it always points to the single most vital aspect of life its ultimat e wholeness. An Indian creation myth relates that the god Brahma , standing on a huge , thousandpetaled lotus, turned his eyes to the four points of the compass. This fourfold survey from the circle of the lotus was a kind of preliminary orientation, an indispensable taking of bearings, before he began his work of creation. A similar story is told of Buddha . At the momen t of his birth, a lotus flower rose from the earth and he stepped into it to gaze into the 10 directions of space. (Th e lotus in this case was eight-rayed; and Buddha also gazed upwar d and downward , making 10 directions.) This symbolic gesture of survey was the most concise method of showing that from the momen t of his birth, the Buddh a was a unique personality, predestined to receive illumination. His personality and his further existence were given the imprint of wholeness. T h e spatial orientation performed by Brahma and Buddh a may be regarded as symbolic of the huma n need for psychic orientation. Th e four functions of consciousness described by Dr. Jung in his chapter, p. 61 thought, feeling, intuition, and sensation equip ma n to deal with the impressions of the world he receives from within and without. It is by means of these functions that he comprehend s and assimilates his experience ; it is by means of them that he can respond. Brahma's four-fold survey of the universe symbolizes the necessary integration of these four functions that ma n must achieve. (In art, the circle is often eight-rayed. This expresses a reciprocal overlapping of the four functions of consciousness, so tha t four further intermediat e functions come abou t — for instance, thought colored by feeling or intuition, or feeling tending toward sensation.) In the visual art of Indi a and the Fa r East, the four- or eight-rayed circle is the usual pattern of the religious images that serve as instruments of meditation. In Tibeta n Lamaism especially, richly figured mandala s play an importan t part. As a rule, these mandala s repre - sent the cosmos in its relation to divine powers. But a great man y of the eastern meditation figures are purely geometrical in design; these are calledyanlras. Aside from the circle, a very commo n yantr a motif is formed by two interpenetrating triangles, one point-upward , the othe r point-downward. Traditionally, thisshape Symbolizes the union of Shiva and Shakti, the male an d female divinities, a subject that also appears in sculptur e in countless variations. In terms of psychological symbolism, it expresses the union of opposites — the union of the personal, tempora l world of the ego with the non-personal, timeless world of the non-ego. Ultimately, this union is the fulfillment and goal of all religions: It is the union of the soul with God. The two interpenetrating triangles have a symbolic meanin g similar to that of the mor e Right, a yantra (a form of mandala). compose d of nine linked triangles The mandala, symbolizing wholeness , is often connecte d wit h exceptional beings of myt h or legend. Far right, a Tibetan painting of the birth of Buddha : in the lower left corner, Buddh a takes his first stepso n a cross forme d of circular blossoms.

The y represent the wholeness of the psyche or Self, of which consciousness is just as muc h a part as the unconscious. In both the triangle yantra s and the sculptural representations of the union of Shiva and Shakti, the emphasis lies on a tension between the opposites. Henc e the marked erotic and emotiona l characte r of man y of them. This dynami c quality implies a process the creation, or coming into being, of wholeness — while the four- or eight-rayed circle represents wholeness as such, as an existing entity. T h e abstract circle also figures in Zen painting. Speaking of a picture entitled The Circle, by the famous Zen priest Sangai, anothe r Zen master writes: "I n the Zen sect, the circle represents enlightenment. It symbolizes huma n perfection. " Abstract mandala s also appea r in Europea n Christian art. Some of the most splendid examples are the rose windows of the cathedrals. Thes e are representations of the Self of ma n transposed onto the cosmic plane. (A cosmic mandal a in the shape of a shining white rose was revealed to Dant e in a vision.) We ma y regard as mandala s the haloes of Christ and the Christian saints in religious paintings. In man y cases, the halo of Christ is alone divided into lour, a significant allusion to his sufferings as the Son of Ma n and his death on the Cross, and at the same time a symbol of his differentiated wholeness. O n the walls of early Romanesqu e churches, abstract circular figures can sometimes be seen; they may go back to pagan originals. In non-Christian art, such circles are called "sun wheels. " The y appea r in rock engravings that dat e back to the neolithic epoch before the wheel was invented. As Jun g has pointed out, the term "sun wheel " denotes only the external aspect of the figure. Wha t really mattered at all times was the experience of an archetypal. 241 Left, an example of the mandala in religious architecture: the Angko r W a t Buddhis t temple in Cambodia , a square buildin g wit h entrances at the four corners. Right, the ruins of a fortified cam p in Denmar k (c. A D . 1000) , whic h wa s laid ou t in a circle - as is the fortress tow n (center right) of Palmanova, Italy (built in 1 593) , wit h its starshaped fortifications . Far right, the streets that meet at L'Etoile, Paris, to for m a mandala inner image , which Stone Age ma n rendered in his art as faithfully as he depicted bulls, gazelles, or wild horses. Man y pictorial mandala s are to be found in Christian art: for example , the rathe r rar e picture of the Virgin in the center of a circular tree, which is the God-symbol of the burnin g bush. The most widely current mandala s in Christian art are those of Christ surrounded by the four Evangelists. Thes e go back to the ancient Egyptian representations of the god Horus and his four sons. In architectur e the mandal a also plays an importan t part but one that often passes unnoticed. It forms the ground plan of both secular and sacred buildings in nearly all civilizations; it enters into classical, medieval, an d even moder n town planning. A classical exampl e appears in Plutarch's account of the foundation of Rome . According to Plutarch, Romulu s sent for builders from Etruri a who instructed him by sacred usages and written rules about all the ceremonies to be observed — in the same way "as in the mysteries. " First they du g a round pit where the Comitium, or Court of Assembly, now stands, and into this pit they threw symbolic offerings of the fruits of the earth. The n each m a n took a small piece of earth of the land from which he came , and these were all thrown into the pit together. Th e pit was given the name of mundus (which also mean t the cosmos). Aroun d it Romulu s drew the boundar y of the city in a circle with a plow drawn by a bull and a cow. Whereve r a gate was planned, the plowshare was taken out and the plow carried over. The city founded in this solemn ceremony was circular in shape. Yet the old and famous description of Rome is urbs quadrata, the squar e city. According to one theory that attempts to reconcile this contradiction, the word quadrata must be understood to mean "quadripartite" ; that is, the circular city was divided into four parts by two main arteries runnin g from north to south and west to east. The point of intersection coincided with the mundus mentioned by Plutarch. According to anothe r theory, the contradic - tion can be understood only as a symbol, namely as a visual representation of the mathematically insoluble problem of the squaring of the circle, which had greatly preoccupied the Greeks and was to play so great a part in alchemy. Strangely enough, before describing the circle ceremony of the foundation of the city by Romulus, Plutarch also speaks of Rome as Roma quadrata, a squar e city. For him, Rome was both a circle and a square . In each theory a true mandal a is involved, and that links u p with Plutarch's statement that the foundation of the city was taught by the Etruscans "a s in the mysteries, " as a secret rite. It was mor e than a mere outwar d form. By its mandal a ground plan, the city, with its inhabitants, is exalted above the purely secular realm. This is further emphasized by the fact tha t the city has a center, the mundus, which established the city's relationship to the "other " realm, the abod e of the ancestral spirits. (Th e mundus was covered by a great stone, called the "soul stone. " O n certain days the stone was removed, and then, it was said, the spirits of the dead rose from the shaft.) A numbe r of medieval cities were founded on the groun d plan of a mandal a and were -' I - surrounded by an approximatel y circular wall. In such a city, as in Rome , two mai n arteries divided it into "quarters " an d led to the four gates. Th e church or cathedra l stood at the point of intersection of these arteries. Th e inspiration of the medieval city with its quarters was the Heavenly Jerusalem (in the Book of Revelation), which had a squar e ground plan and walls with three times four gates. But Jeru - salem had no templ e at its center, for God's immediat e presence was the center of it. (The mandal a ground plan for a city is by no means outmoded. A moder n exampl e is the city of Washington, D.C.) Whethe r in classical or in primitive foundations, the mandal a groun d plan was never dictated by considerations of aesthetics or economics. It was a transformation of the city into an ordered cosmos, a sacred place bound by its center to the othe r world. And this transformation accorded with the vital feelings and needs of religious man . Every building, sacred or secular, tha t has a mandal a groun d plan is the projection of an archetypa l image from within the huma n unconscious onto the oute r world. Th e city, the fortress, and the templ e become symbols of psychic wholeness, and in this way exercise a specific influence on the huma n being who enters or lives in the place. (It need hardly be emphasized that even in architectur e the projection of the psychic content was a purely unconscious process. "Suc h things cannot be thought up, " Dr. Jun g has written, "bu t must grow again from the forgotten depths if they are to express the deepest insights of consciousness and the loftiest intuitions of thespirit, thusamalgamatin g the uniqueness of present-day consciousness with the age-old past of humanity." ) T h e central symbol of Christian art is not the mandala , but the cross or crucifix. U p to Caro - lingian times, the equilateral or Greek cross was the usual form, and therefore the mandal a was indirectly implied. But in the course of time the Medieva l religious architecture wa s usually based o n the shape of the cross. Left, a 1 3th-centur y churc h (in Ethiopia) cut from the rock. Renaissance religious art show s a reorientation to the earth and the body : Right, a plan for a circular churc h or basilica based o n the body' s proportions , draw n by the 1 5th-centur y Italian artist and architect Francesco di Giorgio 243 cente r moved upwar d until the cross took on the Latin form, with the stake an d the crossbeam, tha t is customary today. This development is importan t because it corresponds to the inward development of Christianity up to the high Middl e Ages. In simple terms, it symbolized the tendency to remove the center of ma n and his faith from the earth and to "elevate " it into the spiritual sphere. This tendency sprang from the desire to put into action Christ's saying : "M y kingdom is not of this world. " Earthly life, the world, an d the body were therefore forces that had to be overcome . Medieva l man's hopes were thus directed to the beyond, for it was only from paradise tha t the promise of fulfillment beckoned. This endeavor reached its climax in the Middle Ages and in medieval mysticism. Th e hopes of the beyond found expression not only in the raising of the cente r of the cross; it can also be seen in the increasing height of the Gothi c cathedrals, which seem to set the laws of gravity at defiance. Their cruciform ground plan is that of the elongated Latin cross (though the baptisteries, with the font in the center, have a true mandal a ground plan). With the dawnin g of the Renaissance , a revolutionary change began to occur in man's conception of the world. Th e "upward " movement (which reached its climax in the late Middl e Ages) went into reverse; ma n turned back to the earth. He rediscovered the beauties of natur e and the body, mad e the first circumnavigation of the globe, and proved the world to be a sphere. Th e laws of mechanic s and causality became the foundations of science. Th e world of religious feeling, of the irrational, and of mysticism, which had played so great a part in medieval times, was mor e and mor e submerged by the triumphs of logical thought. Similarly, art became mor e realistic and sensuous. It broke awa y from the religious subjects of the Middl e Ages and embrace d the whole visible world. It was overwhelmed by the manifbldness of the earth, by its splendor and horror, and became wha t Gothi c art had been before it: a true symbol of the spirit of the age. Thu s it can hardly be regarded as accidenta l that a change also came over ecclesiastical building. In contrast to the soaring Gothi c cathedrals, there were mor e circular groun d plans. Th e circle replaced the Latin cross. This change in form, however — and this is the importan t point for the history of symbolism- must be attribute d to aesthetic, an d not to religious, causes. Tha t is the only possible explanation for the fact tha t the center of these round churche s (the truly "holy " place) is empty, and tha t the alta r stands in a recess in a wall away from the center. For tha t reason the plan cannot be described as a true man - dala. An importan t exception is St. Peter's in Rome , which was built to ihe plans of Bramant e and Michelangelo. Her e the alta r stands in the center. On e is tempted , however, to attribut e this exception to the genius of the architects, for great genius is always both of and beyond its time. In spite of the far-reaching change s in art, philosophy, and science brought abou t by the Renaissance, the central symbol of Christianity remained unchanged . Christ was still repre - sented on the Latin cross, as he is today. Tha t meant tha t the cente r of religious ma n remained anchored on a higher, mor e spiritual plane than that of earthly man , who had turned back to nature . Thu s a rift arose between man's traditional Christianity and his rational or intellectual mind. Since tha t time, these two sides of moder n ma n have never been brought together. In the course of the centuries, with man's growing insight into natur e and its laws, this division has gradually grown wider; and it still splits the psyche of the western Christian in the 20th century. Of course, the brief historical summar y given here has been over-simplified. Moreover, it omits the secret religious movements within Christianity tha t took account, in their beliefs, of wha t was usually ignored by most Christians: the question of evil, the chthoni c (or earthly) spirit. Such movements were always in a minority an d seldom had any very visible influence, but in their way they fulfilled the importan t role of a contrapunta l accompaniment to Christian spirituality. The Renaissance interest in outer reality produce d the Copernican sun - centered universe (left) and turned artists awa y from "imaginative " art to nature: Belo w left, Leonardo' s study of the huma n heart. Renaissance art — wit h its sensuous concer n wit h light, nature, and the bod y (far left, a Tintoretto, 16t h century ) — set a pattern that lasted unti l the Impressionists.

Right, a "sun wheel ' in a painting by the moder n Japanese artist Sofu Teshigahara (born 1900 ) follow s the tendenc y of man y moder n painters, whe n using "circular" shapes, to make the m asymmetrical. Amon g the man y sects an d movements that arose abou t A.D. 1000, the alchemists played a very importan t part. The y exalted the mysteries of matte r and set them alongside those of the "heavenly " spirit of Christianity. Wha t they sought was a wholeness of ma n encompassing mind and body, and they invented a thousand name s an d symbols for it. On e of their central symbols was the quadratura circuli (the squaring of the circle), which is no mor e than the true mandala . T h e alchemists not only recorded their work in their writings; they created a wealth of pictures of their dreams and visions —symbolic pictures tha t are still as profound as they are baffling. The y were inspired by the dark side of natur e — evil, the dream, the spirit of earth. T h e mode of expression was always fabulous, dreamlike , an d unreal, in both word and picture. Th e great 15th-century Flemish painte r Hieronymu s Bosch may be regarded as the most importan t representative of this kind of imaginative art. But at the same time, mor e typical Renaissance painters (working in the full light of day, so to speak) were producin g the most splendid works of sensuous art. Their fascination with earth and natur e went so deep tha t it practically determined the development of visual art for the next five centuries. Th e last great representatives of sensuous art, the art of the passing moment, of light and air, were the 19th-century impressionists. W'e may here discriminate between two radically different modes of artistic representation. Man y attempts have been mad e to define their characteristics. Recently Herbert Kiihn (whose work on the cave-paintings I have already mentioned) has tried to draw a distinction between wha t he calls the "imaginative " and the "sensory" style. Th e "sensory" style generally depicts a direct reproduction of natur e or of the picture-subject. Th e "imaginative, " on the other hand, presents a fantasy or experience of the artist in an "unrealistic, " even dreamlike, and sometimes "abstract " manner. Kiihn's two conceptions seem so simple and so clear that I am glad to make use of them. T h e first beginnings of imaginative art go back very far in history. In the Mediterranea n basin, its efflorescence dates from the third millennium B.C . It has only recently been realized that these ancient works of art are not the results of incompetenc e or ignorance ; they are modes of expression of a perfectly definite religious and spiritual emotion. And they have a special appea l today, for, durin g the last halfcentury, art has been passing once more through a phase that can be described by the term "imaginative. " Toda y the geometrical, or "abstract, " symbol of the circle has again come to play a considerable role in painting. But with few exceptions the traditional mode of representation has undergone a characteristic transformation that corresponds to the dilemma of modern man's ex246 istence. The circle is no longer a single mean - ingful figure tha t embrace s a whole world and dominate s the picture. Sometime s the artist has taken it out of its dominan t position, replacing it by a loosely organized grou p of circles. Some - times the plane of the circle is asymmetrical. An exampl e of the asymmetrica l circular plane may be seen in the famous sun disks of the French painte r Robert Delaunay. A painting by the moder n English painte r Ceri Richards, now in Dr. Jung's collection, contains an entirely asymmetrica l circular plane , while far to the left there appears a very muc h smaller and empt y circle. In the French painte r Henri Matisse's Slill Life with Vase of Nasturtiums, the focus of vision is a green sphere on a slanting black beam, which seems to gathe r into itself the manifold circles of the nasturtium leaves. Th e sphere overlaps a rectangula r figure, the top left-hand corne r of which is folded over. Given the artistic perfection of the painting it is easy to forget that in the past these two abstract figures (the circle and the square) would have been united, and would have expressed a world of thoughts and feelings. But anyone who does remember, and raises the question of meaning, will find food for thought: Th e two figures that from the beginning of time have formed a whole are in this painting torn apart or incoherently related. Yet both are there and are touching each other. In a picture painted by the Russian-born artist VVassily Kandinsky there is a loose assembly of colored balls or circles that seem to be drifting like soap bubbles. They. too. are tenuously connected with a background of one large rectangle with two small, almost squar e rectangles contained in it. I n anothe r picture, which he called A Few Circles, a dark cloud (or is it a Left, Limits of Understanding by Paul Klee (1879-1940 ) —one20th - centur y paintin g in whic h the symbo l of the circle retains a dominan t position. *47 swooping bird?) again bears a loosely arrange d grou p of bright balls or circles. Circles often appea r in unexpected connections in the mysterious compositions ol the British artist Paul Nash. In the primeval solitude of his landscape Event on the Downs, a ball lies in the right foreground. Thoug h it is apparentl y a tennis ball, the design on its surface forms the Tai-gi-tit, the Chinese symbol of eternity; thus it opens up a new dimension in the loneliness of the landscape. Something similar happen s in Nash's Landscape from a Dream. Balls are rolling out of sight in an infinitely wide mirrored landscape , with a huge sun visible on the horizon. Anothe r ball lies in the foreground, in front of the roughly squar e mirror. In his drawin g Limits of Understanding, the Swiss artist Paul Klee places the simple figure of a sphere or a circle above a complex strucCircles appear broken or loosely scattered in The Sun and the Moon. top, by Robert Delaunay (188 5 1941) ; in A Few Circles, left, by Kandinsk y (1866-1944) ; and in Landscape from a Dream, right, by Paul Nash (1889-1946 ) Below , Composition by Piet Mondria n (1872-1944 ) is dominate d by squares. 248 ture of ladders and lines. Dr. Jun g has pointed out thai a true symbol appears only when there is a need to express wha t thought cannot think or what is only divined or felt; that is the purpose of Rice's simple figure at the "limits of understanding. " It is important to note that the square , or groups of rectangles and squares, or rectangles and rhomboids, have appeare d in modern art just as often as the circle. The master of harmonious (indeed, "musical " ) compositions with squares is the Dutch-bor n artist Piet Mondrian . As a rule there is no actua l center in any of his pictures, yet they form an ordered whole in their own strict, almost ascetic fashion. Still more commo n are paintings by othe r artists with irregular quaternar y compositions, or numerous rectangles combine d in mor e or less loose groups. T h e circle is a symbol of the psyche even Plato described the psyche as a sphere). Th e squar e 'an d often the rectangle is a symbol ofearthboun d matter, of the body and reality. In most moder n art, the connection between these two primary forms is either nonexistent, or loose and casual. Their separation is anothe r symbolic expression of the psychic state of 20th-century man : His soul has lost its roots and he is threatened bv dissociation. Even in the world situation of today fas Dr. Jun g pointed out in his opening chap - ter), this split has become evident: Th e western and eastern halves of the earth are separated by an Iron Curtain . But the frequency with which the squar e and the circle appea r must not be overlooked. There seems to be an uninterrupte d psychic urge to bring into consciousness the basic factors of life that they symbolize. Also, in certain abstract pictures of our time (which merely represent a colored structur e or a kind of "prima l matter " ), these forms occasionally appea r as if they were germs of new growth. The symbol of the circle has played a curious part in a very different phenomeno n of the life of our day, and occasionally still does so. In the last years of the Second World War, there arose the "visionary rumor " of round flying bodies that became known as "flying saucers " or IT'O s unidentified flying objects). Jun g has explained the UFO s as a projection of a psychic content (of wholeness that has at all times been symbolized by the circle. In other winds, this "visionary rumor, " as can also be seen in man y dreams of our time, is an attemp t by the unconscious collective psyche to heal the split in our apocalypti c age by means of the symbol of the circle. - 1') Above , an illustration from a 1 6th centur y German broadsheet of some strange circular object s seen in the sky - similar to the "flyin g saucers " that have been seen in recent years. Jun g has suggested that such visions are projections of the archetype of wholeness . Modern painting as a symbol T h e terms "moder n art " and "moder n painting " are used in this chapte r as the layma n uses them. Wha t I will be dealing with, to use Kiihn"s term, is moder n imaginative painting. Pictures of this kind can be "abstract " (or rathe r "non-figurative" ) but they need not always be so. Ther e will be no attemp t to distinguish amon g such various forms as fauvism, cubism, expressionism, futurism, suprematism, constructivism, orphism, and so on. Any specific allusion to one or the other of these groups will be quit e exceptional. And I am not concerned with an aesthetic differentiation of moder n paintings; nor, above all, with artistic evaluations. Moder n imagina - tive painting is here taken simply as a phenome - non of our time. Tha t is the only way in which the question of its symbolic content can be justified and answered. In this brief chapte r it is possible to mention only a few artists, and to select a few of their works mor e or less at random. I must content myself with discussing modern painting in terms of a small numbe r of its representatives. M y starting point is the psychological fact tha t the artist has at all times been the instrument and spokesman of the spirit of his age. His work can be only partly understood in terms of his personal psychology. Consciously or unconsciously, the artist gives form to the natur e and values of his time, which in their turn form him. T h e moder n artist himself often recognizes the interrelation of the work of art and its time. Thu s the French critic an d painte r Jea n Bazaine writes in his Notes on Contemporary Painting: "Nobod y paints as he likes. All a painte r can do is to will with all his might the painting his age is capabl e of." Th e Germa n artist Franz Marc , who died in the First World War, said: "Th e grea t artists d o not seek their forms in the mist of the past, but take the deepest soundings they can of the genuine , profoundest center of gravity of their age. " And, as far back as 1911, Kandinsky wrote in his famous essay "Concernin g the Spiritual in Art" : "Ever y epoch is given its own measure of artistic freedom, and even the most creative genius ma y not leap over the boundar y of that freedom. " For the last 50 years, "moder n art " has been a general bone of contention, and the discussion has lost none of its heat. Th e "yeas " are as passionate as the "nays" ; yet the reiterated prophecy tha t "modern " art is finished has never come true. Th e new way of expression has been triumphan t to an unimagine d degree. If it is threatened at all, it will be because it has degenerated into mannerism and modishness. (In the Soviet Union , wher e non-figurative art has often been officially discouraged and produced only in private, figurative art is threatened by a similar degeneration.) T h e general public , in Europ e at an y rate, is still in the heat of the battle. Th e violence of the discussion shows tha t feeling runs high in both camps. Even those wh o are hostile to moder n art cannot avoid being impressed by the works they reject; they are irritated or repelled, but (as the violence of their feelings shows) they are moved. As a rule, the negative fascination is no less strong than the positive. T h e stream of visitors to exhibitions of moder n art, whereve r and wheneve r they take place, testifies to something mor e than curiosity. Curiosity would be satisfied sooner. An d the fantastic prices tha t are paid for works of moder n art are a measur e of the status conferred upo n them by society. Fascination arises when the unconscious has been moved. Th e effect produced by works of moder n art cannot be explained entirely by their visible form. T o the eye trained in "classic" or "sensory" art," they ar e new and alien. Nothing in works of non-figurative art reminds the spectator of his own world no objects in 250 their own everyday surroundings, no huma n being or anima l tha t speaks a familiar language. Ther e is no welcome , no visible accord in the cosmos created by the artist. And yet, without any question, ther e is a huma n bond. It may be even mor e intense than in works of sensory art, which mak e a direct appea l to feeling and empathy . It is the aim of the moder n artist to give expression to his inne r vision of man , to the spiritual background of life and the world. Th e moder n work of art has abandone d not only the realm of the concrete, "natural, " sensuous world, but also tha t of the individual. It has become highly collective an d therefore (even in the abbreviation of the pictorial hieroglyph) touches not only the few but the many . Wha t remains individual is the manne r of representation, the style an d quality of the moder n work of art. It is often difficult for the layman to recognize whethe r the artist's intentions ar e genuine and his expressions spontaneous, neither imitated nor aimed at effect. In man y cases he must accustom himself to new kinds of line an d color. He must learn them, as he would learn a foreign language , before he can judg e their expressiveness and quality. T h e pioneers of moder n art have apparentl y understood how muc h they were asking of the public. Never have artists published so man y "manifestoes'" and explanations of their aims as in the 20th century. It is, however, not only to others that they are striving to explain an d justify wha t they are doing ; it is also to themselves. For the most part, these manifestoes are artistic confessions of faith —poetic and often confused or self-contradictory attempts to give clarity to the strange outcome of today's artistic activities. Wha t really matters, of course, is (and always has been) the direct encounte r with the work of art. Yet, for the psychologist wh o is concerned with the symbolic content of modern art, the study of these writings is most instructive. For tha t reason the artists, whereve r possible, will be allowed in the following discussion to speak for themselves. T h e beginnings of moder n art appeared in the early 1900s. On e of the most impressive personalities of that initiatory phase was Kan - dinsky, whose influence is still clearly traceabl e in the paintings of the second half of the century. Man y of his ideas have proved prophetic . In his essay "Concernin g Form, " he writes: "Th e art of today embodie s the spiritual ma - tured to the point of revelation. Th e forms of this embodimen t may be arrange d between two poles: (1) great abstraction; (2) great realism. Thes e two poles open two paths, which both lead to one goal in the end. Thes e two elements have always been present in art; the first was expressed in the second. Toda y it looks as if they were abou t to carry on separat e existences. Art seems to have put an end to the pleasant completion of the abstract by the concrete, and vice versa. " Sensory (or representational) art versus imaginative (or "unrealistic") art: Right, a painting by the 19th - centur y British artist Willia m Frith, part of a sequence depictin g a gambler' s downfall . This is one extreme of representational art: It has declined into mannerism and sentiment. Left, an extreme of imaginative (and, here, "abstract") art by Kasimir Malevic h (1878-1935) .

Below , in a sculpture by Picasso (1881 -1973) , ordinary object s —leaves—ar e part of the subject rather than the material. T o illustrate Kandinsky's point tha t the two elements of art, the abstrac t an d the concrete, have parte d company : In 1913, the Russian painte r Kasimir Malevich painted a picture tha t consisted only of a black squar e on a white ground. It was perhaps the first purely "ab - stract " picture ever painted. H e wrote of it: " I n my desperat e struggle to liberate art from the ballast of the world of objects, I took refuge in the form of the square. " A year later, the French painte r Marce l Ducham p set up an object chosen at random (a bottle rack) on a pedestal an d exhibited it. Jea n Bazaine wrote of it: "This bottle rack, torn from its utilitarian context and washed up on the beach, has been invested with the lonely dignity of the derelict. Good for nothing, there to be used, ready for anything , it is alive. It lives on the fringe of existence its own disturbing, absurd life. Th e disturbing object tha t is the first step to art. " In its weird dignity and abandonment , the object was immeasurabl y exalted and given significance tha t can only be called magical. Henc e its "disturbing, absurd life." It became an idol and at the same time an object of mockery. Its intrinsic reality was annihilated. Both Malcvich's squar e and Duchamp's bottle rack were symbolic gestures that had nothing to do with art in the strict sense of the word. Yet they mar k the two extremes ("great abstraction " an d "grea t realism" ) between which the imaginative art of the succeeding decades ma y be aligned and understood. From the psychological standpoint, the two gestures toward the naked object (matter) and the naked non-object (spirit) point to a collective psychic rift that created its symbolic expression in the years before the catastrophe of the First World War. This rift ha d first appeare d in the Renaissance, whe n it became manifest as a conflict between knowledge and faith. Mean - while, civilization was removing ma n further and further from his instinctual foundation, so that a gulf opened between natur e and mind, between the unconscious and consciousness. Thes e opposites characteriz e the psychic situation tha t is seeking expression in moder n art. The secret soul of things As we have seen, the starting point of "th e concrete " was Duchamp's famous — or notorious— bottle rack. Th e bottle rack was not intended to be artistic in itself. Ducham p called himself an "anti-artist. " But it brough t to light an element tha t was to mea n a great deal to artists for a long time to come. Th e name they gave to it was objel Iroiwe or "ready-made. " T h e Spanish painte r Joa n Miro, for instance, goes to the beach every dawn "to collect things washed up by the tide. Things lying there, waiting for someone to discover their personality. " H e keeps his finds in his studio. Now and then he assembles some of them and the most curious compositions result: "Th e artist is often surprised himself at the shapes of his own creation. " As far back as 1912, the Spanish-born artist Pablo Picasso and the French artist Georges Braque mad e wha t they called "collages " from scraps of rubbish. Ma x Ernst cut clippings from the illustrated papers of the so-called age of big business, assembled them as the fancy took him, and so transformed the stuffy solidity of the bourgeois age into a demonic , dreamlike unreality. Th e Germa n painte r Kurt Schwitters worked with the contents of his ash can : He used nails, brown paper, ragged scraps of newspaper, railway tickets, and remnants of cloth. He succeeded in assembling this rubbish with such seriousness and freshness tha t surprising effects of strange beauty came about. In Schwitters' obsession with things, however, this manne r of composition occasionally became merely absurd. He mad e a construction of rubbish that he called " a cathedra l built for things. " Schwitters worked on it for 10 years, and three stories of his own house had to be demolished to give him the space he needed. Schwitters' work, and the magical exaltation of the object, give the first hint of the place of modern art in the history of the huma n mind, and of its symbolic significance. The y reveal 253 the tradition tha t was being unconsciously perpetuated. It is the tradition of the hermeti c Christian brotherhoods of the Middl e Ages, and of the alchemists, wh o conferred even on matter, the stuff of the earth, the dignity of their religious contemplation. Schwitters' exaltation of the grossest materia l to the rank of art, to a "cathedral " (in which the rubbish would leave no room for a huma n being), faithfully followed the old alchemica l tenet according to which the sought-for precious object is to be found in filth. Kandinsk y expressed the same ideas whe n he wrote : "Everythin g tha t is dead quivers. Not only the things of poetry, stars, moon, wood, flowers, but even a white trouser butto n glittering out of a puddl e in the street ... . Everything has a secret soul, which is silent mor e often than it speaks. " Wha t the artists, like the alchemists, prob - ably did not realize was the psychological fact that they were projecting part of their psyche into matte r or inanimat e objects. Henc e the "mysterious animation " tha t entered into such things, and the great value attached even to rubbish. The y projected their own darkness, their earthly shadow, a psychic content tha t they and their time had lost and abandoned . Unlike the alchemists, however, me n like Schwitters were not contained in and protected by the Christian order. In one sense, Schwitters' work is opposed to it: A kind of monomani a binds him to matter, while Christianity seeks to vanquish matter. And yet, paradoxically, it is Schwitters' monomani a tha t robs the material in his creations of its inherent significance as concrete reality. In his pictures, matte r is transformed into an "abstract " composition. Therefore it begins to discard its substantiality, and to dissolve. In tha t very process, these pictures become a symbolic expression of our time, which has seen the concept of the "absolute " concreteness of matte r undermine d by moder n atomi c physics. Painters began to think abou t the "magi c object " and the "secret soul " of things. Th e Italian painte r Carlo Carr a wrote : "It is commo n things tha t reveal those forms of simplicity through which wc can realize that higher, mor e significant condition of being wher e the whole splendor of art resides." Paul Klee said: "Th e object expands beyond the bounds of its appearanc e by our knowledge tha t the thing is mor e than its exterior presents to our eyes. " An d Jea n Bazaine wrote : "An object awakens our love just because it seems to be the beare r of powers tha t are greater than itself." Sayings of this kind recall the old alchemical concept of a "spirit in matter, " believed to be the spirit in an d behind inanimat e objects like metal or stone. Psychologically interpreted, this spirit is the unconscious. It always manifests itself when conscious or rational knowledge has reached its limits and mystery sets in, for man tends to fill the inexplicable and mysterious with the contents of his unconscious. H e projects them, as it were, into a dark, empty vessel. The feeling that the object was "mor e than met the eye, " which was shared by man y artists, found a most remarkabl e expression in the work of the Italian painte r Giorgio de Chirico. He was a mystic by temperament, and a tragic seeker who never found wha t he sought. On his self-portrait (1908) he wrote : El quid, amabo nisi quod aenigma esl ("And wha t am I to love if not the enigma?"). Chirico was the founder of the so-called pillura melajisica. "Ever y object, " he wrote, "ha s two aspects: Th e commo n aspect, which is the one we generally sec an d which is seen by everyone, and the ghostly and metaphysical aspect, which only rare individuals see at moments of clairvoyance and metaphysical meditation. A work of art must relate something that does not appea r in its visible form. " Chirico's works reveal this "ghostly aspect " of things. The y are dreamlike transpositions of reality, which arise as visions from the unconscious. But his "metaphysica l abstraction " is expressed in a panic-stricken rigidity, and the atmospher e of the pictures is one of nightmar e and of fathomless melancholy. Th e city squares of Italy, the towers and objects, are set in an over-acut e perspective, as if they were in a vacuum, illuminated by a merciless, cold light 254 A n example of "surrealist" art: Les Souliers Rouges, by the French painter Rene Magntt e (1898-1967 ) Muc h of the disturbing effect of surrealist painting comes from its association and juxtapositio n of unrelated object s often absurd, irrational, and dreamlike from an unseen source. Antiqu e heads or statues of gods conjure up the classical past. In one of the most terrifying of his pictures, he has placed beside the marbl e head oi a goddess a pair of red rubbe r gloves, a "magi c object'" in the moder n sense. A green ball on the ground acts as a symbol, uniting the crass opposites; without it, there would be mor e than a hint of psychic disintegration. This picture was clearly not the result of over-sophisticated deliberation ; it must be taken as a dream picture. Chirico was deeply influenced by the philosophies of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. He wrote : "Schopenhaue r and Nietzsche were the first to teach the deep significance of the senselessness of life, and to show how this senselessness could be transformed into art ... . Th e dreadful void they discovered is the very soulless and untroubled beauty of matter. " It may be doubte d whethe r Chirico succeeded in transposing the "dreadful void" into "untrouble d beauty. " Some of his pictures are extremely disturbing; man y are as terrifying as nightmares. But in his effort to find artistic expression for the void, he penetrated to the core of the existential dilemma of contemporar y man . Nietzsche, whom Chirico quotes as his auth - ority, has given a name to the "dreadful void" in his saying "Go d is dead. " Without referring to Nietzsche, Kandinsky wrote in On the Spiritual in Art: "Heave n is empty. God is dead. " A phras e of this kind may sound abominable . But it is not new. Th e idea of the "deat h of God " and its immediat e consequence , the "meta - physical void. " had troubled the minds of 19thcentury poets, especially in Franc e and Germany. It was a long development that, in the 20th century, reached the stage of open discussion and found expression in art. The cleavage between modern art and Christianity was finally accomplished. Dr. Jun g also came to realize that this strange and mysterious phenomeno n of the death of God is a psychic fact of our time. In 1937 he wrote : " I know and here I am expressing what countless othe r people know that the present time is the time of God's disappearanc e and death. " For years he had observed the Christian God-imag e fading in his patients" dreams that is, in the unconscious of moder n men. Th e loss of that image is the loss of the supreme factor that gives life a meaning. It must be pointed out, however, that neither Nietzsche's assertion that God is dead, nor Chirico's ""metaphysical void, " nor Jung's deductions from unconscious images, have anything final to say about the reality and existence of God or of a transcendenta l being or not-being. The y are huma n assertions. In each case they are based, as Jun g ha s shown in Psychology and Religion, on contents of the unconscious psyche that have entered consciousness in tangible form as images, dreams, ideas, or intuitions. Th e origin of these contents, and the cause of such a transformation (from a living to a dead God), must remain unknown , on the frontier of mystery. Chirico never came to a solution ol the problem presented to him by the unconscious. His failure may be seen most clearly in his representation of the huma n figure. Given the present religious situation, it is man himself to whom Both Giorgio de Chirico (born 1888 ) and Mar c Chagal l (born 1887 ) have sough t to look behind the outwar d appearances of things; their wor k seems to have risen fro m the depth s of the unconscious . But Chirico' s vision (below , his Philosopher and Poet) wa s gloomy , melancholy , even nightmarish. Chagall's has alway s been rich, warm , and alive. Right, o ne of his great stained-glass window s created in 196 2 for a Jerusalem synagogu e In Chmco' s Song of Love (left), the marble head of the goddes s a nd the rubber glove are crass opposite s The green ball seems t o act as a uniting symbo l Right, Metaphysical Muse by —Carl o Carra (188 1 -1966 ) The faceless maniki n wa s a frequent them e of Chirico' s as well . 25 6 should be accorded a new, if impersonal, dignity and responsibility. (Jun g described it as a responsibility to consciousness.) But in Chirico's work, ma n is deprived of his soul; he becomes a mamchino, a puppe t without a face (and therefore also without consciousness). In the various versions of his Great Metaphysician, a faceless figure is enthroned on a pedestal mad e of rubbish. Th e figure is a consciously or unconsciously ironical representation of the ma n who strives to discover the "truth " abou t metaphysics, and at the same time a symbol of ultimat e loneliness and senselessness. O r perhaps the manichini (which also haun t the works of other contemporar y artists) are a premonition of the faceless mass man . Whe n he was 40, Chirico, abandone d his/;//- lura metafisica; he turned back to traditiona l modes, but his work lost depth . Her e is certain proof that there is no "bac k to wher e you came from" for the creative mind whose unconscious has been involved in the fundamenta l dilemma of modern existence. A counterpart to Chirico might be seen in the Russian-born painte r Mar c Chagall. His quest in his work is also a "mysterious and lonely poetry " and "th e ghostly aspect of things tha t only rare individuals may see. " But Cha - gall's rich symbolism is rooted in the piety of Eastern Jewish Hassidism and in a warm feeling for life. He was faced with neither the problem of the void nor the death of God. He wrote : "Everythin g may change in our demoralized world except the heart, man's love, and his striving to know the divine. Painting, like all poetry, has its part in the divine ; people feel this today just as muc h as they used to. " T h e British autho r Sir Herbert Rea d once wrote of Chagall tha t he never quit e crossed the threshold into the unconscious, but "ha s always kept one foot on the earth tha t had nourished him. " This is exactly the "right " relation to the unconscious. It is all the mor e importan t that, as Rea d emphasizes, "Chagall has remained one of the most influential artists of our time. " With the contrast between Chagall and Chirico, a question arises tha t is importan t for the understandin g of symbolism in moder n art: H o w does the relationship between consciousness and the unconscious take shape in the work of moder n artists? Or, to put it anothe r way, wher e does ma n stand? O n e answe r ma y be found in the movemen t called surrealism, of which the French poet Andr e Breton is regarded as the founder. (Chirico too ma y be described as a surrealist.) As a student of medicine, Breton had been introduced to the work of Freud. Thu s dreams came to play an importan t part in his ideas. "Ca n dreams not be used to solve the fundamenta l problems of life?" he wrote. " I believe tha t the apparen t antagonism between dream an d reality will be resolved in a kind of absolute reality — in surreality. " Breton grasped the point admirably . Wha t he sought was a reconciliation of the opposites, consciousness and the unconscious. But the way he took to reach his goal could only lead him astray. He began to experiment with Freud's metho d of free association as well as with automati c writing, in which the words an d phrases arising from the unconscious are set down without any conscious control. Breton called it: "thought's dictation, independen t of anv aesthetic or mora l preoccupation. " But tha t process simply means tha t the way is opened to the stream of unconscious images, and the importan t or even decisive part to be played by consciousness is ignored. As Dr. Jun g has shown in his chapter, it is consciousness tha t holds the key to the values of the unconscious, and tha t therefore plays the decisive part. Consciousness alone is competen t to determine the meanin g of the images and to recognize their significance for ma n here and now, in the concrete reality of the present. Only in an interplay of consciousness and the unconscious can the unconscious prove its value, and perhaps even show a way to overcome the melancholy of the void. If the unconscious, once in action, is left to itself, there is a risk tha t its contents will become overpowering or will manifest their negative, destructive side. If we look at surrealist pictures (like Salvador Dali's The Burning Giraffe) with this in mind. 257 we may feel the wealth of their fantasy and the overwhelming powe r of their unconscious imagery, but we realize the horror an d the symbolism of the end of all things tha t speaks from man y of them. Th e unconscious is pur e nature , and , like nature , pours out its gifts in profusion. But left to itself an d without the huma n response from consciousness, it can (again like nature ) destroy its own gifts an d sooner or later sweep them into annihilation. T h e question of the role of consciousness in moder n painting also arises in connection with the use of chance as a means of composing paintings. In Beyond Painting Ma x Ernst wrote : "Th e association of a sewing machin e and an umbrell a on a surgical table [he is quotin g from the poet Lautreamont] is a familiar example , which has now become classical, of the phenomeno n discovered by the surrealists, tha t the association of two (or more) apparentl y alien elements on a plane alien to both is the most potent ignition of poetry. " Tha t is probabl y as difficult for the layma n to comprehen d as the commen t Breton mad e to the same effect: "Th e ma n wh o cannot visualize a horse galloping on a tomat o is an idiot. " One of the best-know n of moder n "surrealist" painters is Salvador Dali (born 1904 ) Above , his famou s painting The Burning Giraffe. Below , one of Ma x Ernst's frottages (usually rubbing s taken from scratches on tiles), fro m his Natural History. Ernst's Natural History resembles the interest taken in the past in "accidental" patterns in nature. Below , an engraving of an 18th - centur y Dutc h museu m exhibit that is also a kind of surrealist "natural history " wit h its inclusion of coral, stones, and skeletons. 2 5 8 (We might recall here the "chance " association of a marbl e head and red rubbe r gloves in Chirico's picture.) Of course, man y of these associations were intended as jokes an d nonsense. But most moder n artists have been concerned with something radically different from jokes. Chanc e plays a significant part in the work of the French sculptor Jea n (or Hans) Arp . His woodcuts of leaves an d othe r forms, thrown together at random, were anothe r expression of the quest for, as he put it, " a secret, prima l meaning slumbering beneat h the world of ap - pearances. " He called them Leaves arranged according to the laws of chance an d Squares arranged according to the laws of chance. In these compositions it is chanc e tha t gives dept h to the work of art; it points to an unknown but active principle of orde r an d meanin g tha t becomes manifest in things as their "secret soul. " It was above all the desire to "mak e chanc e essential" (in Paul Klee's words) tha t underlay the surrealists' efforts to take the grain of wood, cloud formations, an d so on as a starting point for their visionary painting. Ma x Ernst, for instance, went back to Leonard o da Vinci, who wrote an essay on Botticelli's remar k tha t if you throw a paint-soaked sponge at a wall, in the splashes it makes you will see heads, animals, landscapes, an d a host of othe r configurations. Ernst has described how a vision pursued him in 1925. It forced itself on him as he was staring at a tiled floor marked by thousands of scratches. "I n orde r to give foundation to my powers of meditation and hallucination, I mad e a series of drawings of the tiles by laying sheets of pape r on them at random and then taking graphit e rubbings. Whe n I fixed my eyes on the result, I was astounded by a suddenly sharpened sense of a hallucinatory series of contrasting and superposed pictures. I mad e a collection of the first results obtained from these 'frottages' and called it Hisloire Nalurelle." It is importan t to note tha t Ernst placed over or behind some of these frottages a ring or circle, which gives the pictur e a peculiar atmo - sphere and depth . Her e the psychologist can recognize the unconscious drive to oppose the chaotic hazards of the image's natura l language by the symbol of a self-contained psychic whole, thus establishing equilibrium. Th e ring or circle dominate s the picture . Psychic wholeness rules nature , itself meaningful and giving meaning. Right. Roma n coins used in places progressively farther awa y fro m Rome. On the last coin (farthest fro m the controlling center) the face has disintegrated. This strangely corresponds to the psychi c disintegration that such drugs as LSD 2 5 can induce. Below, drawing s don e by an artist w h o took this drug in a test held in Germany in 1951 . The drawing s gro w more abstract as conscious control is overcom e by the unconscious . 2 59 Iii Ma x Ernst's efforts to pursue the secret patter n in things, we ma y detect an affinity with the 19th-century Romantics. The y spoke of nature's "handwriting," ' which can be seen everywhere , on wings, eggshells, in clouds, snow, ice crystals, an d othe r "strang e conjunctions of chance " just as muc h as in dreams or visions. The y saw everything as the expression of one and the same "pictoria l language of nature. " Thu s it was a genuinely romanti c gestur e whe n Ma x Ernst called the pictures produced by his experiments "natura l history. " A n d he was right, for the unconscious (which had conjured u p the pictures in the chanc e configuration of things) is nature . It is with Ernst's Natural History or Arp's compositions of chanc e tha t the reflections of the psychologist begin. He is faced with the question of wha t meanin g a chanc e arrange - ment—whereve r and wheneve r it comes abou t — can have for the ma n wh o happen s on it. With this question, ma n and consciousness come into the matter, and with them the possibility of meaning. The chance-created pictur e ma y be beautiful or ugly, harmoniou s or discordant, rich or poor in content, well- or ill-painted. Thes e factors determin e its artistic value, but they cannot satisfy the psychologist (often to the distress of the artist or of anyon e wh o finds supreme satisfaction in the contemplation of form). Th e psychologist seeks further an d tries to understan d the "secret code " of chanc e arrangemen t -i n so far as ma n can deciphe r it at all. Th e number and form of the objects thrown together at random by Ar p raise as man y questions as any detail of Ernst's fantastic frottages. For the psychologist, they are symbols; an d therefore they can not only be felt but (up to a certain point) can also be interpreted. T h e apparen t or actua l retreat of ma n from man y moder n works of art, the lack of reflection, and the predominanc e of the unconscious over consciousness offer critics frequent points of attack. The y speak of pathological art or compar e it with pictures by the insane, for it is characteristic of psychosis tha t consciousness and the ego-personality are submerged and "drowned " by floods of contents from the unconscious regions of the psyche. It is true tha t the comparison is not so odious today as it was even a generation ago. Whe n Dr. Jun g first pointed out a connection of this kind in his essay on Picasso (1932), it provoked a storm of indignation. Today , the catalogue of a well-known Zurich art gallery speaks of the "almost schizophrenic obsession" of a famous artist, and the Germa n writer Rudolf Kassner described Georg Trak l as "on e of the greatest Germa n poets, " continuing : "Ther e was something schizophrenic abou t him. It can be felt in his work ; there is a touch of schizophreni a in it too. Yes, Trak l is a great poet. " It is now realized tha t a state of schizophreni a and the artistic vision are not mutually exclusive. T o my mind, the famous experiments with mescalin and similar drugs have contributed to this change of attitude . Thes e drugs create a condition accompanie d by intense visions of colors and forms — not unlike schizophrenia . Mor e than one artist of today has sought inspiration in such a drug. The retreat from reality Franz Mar c once said : "Th e art tha t is coming will give formal expression to our scientific conviction. " This was a truly propheti c saying. We have traced the influence on artists of Freud's psychoanalysis an d of the discovery (or rediscovery) of the unconscious in the early years of the 20th century. Anothe r importan t point is the connection between moder n art an d the results of research in nuclea r physics. T o put it in simple, nonscientific terms, nuclear physics has robbed the basic units of matte r of their absolute concreteness. It has mad e matte r mysterious. Paradoxically, mass and energy, wave an d particle, have proved to be interchangeable . The laws of cause and effect have become valid only u p to a certain point. It does not matte r at all that these relativities, discontinuities, and paradoxe s hold good only on the margins of our world only for the infinitely small (the atom) an d the infinitely great (the cosmos). The y have caused a revolutionary chang e in the concept of reality, for a new. totally different, and irrational reality has dawne d behind the reality of our "natural " world, which is ruled by the laws of classical physics. Corresponding relativities and paradoxe s were discovered in the domai n of the psyche. Here. too. anothe r world dawne d on the margin of the world of consciousness, governed by new and hitherto unknown laws that are strangely akin to the laws of nuclea r physics. T h e parallelism between nuclea r physics and the psychology of the collective unconscious was often a subject of discussion between Jun g and Wolfgang Pauli, the Xobel prizewinne r in physics. Th e space-time continuum of physics and the collective unconscious can be seen, so to speak, as the oute r an d inner aspects of one and the same reality behind appearances. (The relationship between physics an d psychology will be discussed by Dr. M.-L. von Franz in her concluding essay.) It is characteristic of this one world behind the worlds of physics and the psyche that its laws, processes, and contents are unimaginable . Tha t is a fact of outstandin g importanc e for the understandin g of the art of our time. For the main subject of moder n art is, in a certain sense, unimaginabl e too. Therefore muc h modern art has become "abstract. " Th e great artists of this century have sought to give visible form to the "life behind things " and so their works are a symbolic expression of a world behind The paintings on these pages, all by Franz Mar c (1880-1916) , sho w his gradual developmen t awa y from a concer n wit h outwar d things , towar d a more completel y "abstract" art Far left, Blue Horses (191 1 ); center, Roesina Wood (1913-14) ; below , Play of Forms (1914) , consciousness (or, indeed, behind dreams, for dreams are only rarely non-figurative). Thu s they point to the "one " reality, the "one " life, which seems to be the commo n backgroun d of the two domain s of physical an d psychicappearances. Onl y a few artists realized the connection between their form of expression and physics an d psychology. Kandinsk y is one of the masters who expressed the dee p emotion he felt at the early discoveries of moder n physical research. "I n my mind, the collapse of the atom was the collaps e of the whole world: Suddenly the stoutest walls fell. Everything turned unstable, insecure, an d soft. I would not have been surprised if a stone had melted into thin air before my eyes. Science seemed to have been annihilated. " Wha t resulted from this disillusion was the artist's withdrawa l from the "realm of nature, " from the "populou s foreground of things. " "It seemed, " Kandinsk y added , "a s if I saw art steadily disengaging itself from nature. " This separation from the world of things happene d mor e or less at the same time to othe r artists, too. Fran z Mar c wrote : "Hav e we not learned from a thousand years of experience tha t things cease to speak the mor e we hold u p to them the visual mirror of their appearance ? Appearanc e is eternally flat. . . . " For Marc , the goal of art was "t o reveal unearthly life dwelling behind everything, to break the mirror of life so tha t we ma y look being in the face. " Paul Klee wrote : "Th e artist does not ascribe to the natura l form of Left, Piet Mondrian' s Painting No 7—a n example of the moder n approac h to "pur e form " (Mondrian' s term) throug h the use of wholl y abstract, geometrical shapes. The art of Paul Klee is a visual exploration and expression of the spirit in and behind nature—th e unconsciou s or, as he termed it, the "secretly perceived." Sometime s his vision can be disturbing and demonic , as in his Death and Fire, right; or it can be a more poetic kind of fantasy, as in his Sinbad the Sailor (far right). appearanc e the same convincing significance as the realists wh o ar e his critics. H e does not feel so intimately boun d to tha t reality, because he cannot see in the formal products of natur e the essence of the creative process. H e is mor e concerned with formative powers tha n with formal products. " Piet Mondria n accused cubism of not having pursued abstraction to its logical end, "th e expression of pur e reality. " Tha t can only be attained by the "creation of pur e form, " unconditioned by subjective feelings an d ideas. "Behind changin g natura l forms there lies changeless pur e reality. " A grea t numbe r of artists wer e seeking to get past appearance s into the "reality " of the backgroun d or the "spirit in matter " by a transmutatio n of things —throug h fantasy, surrealism, dream pictures, the use of chance , etc. Th e "abstract " artists, however, turned their backs on things. Their paintings contained no identifiable concrete objects; they were, in Mon - drian's words, simply "pur e form. " But it must be realized tha t wha t these artists were concerned with was something far greate r than a problem of form an d the distinction between "concrete " an d "abstract, " figurative a a d non-figurative. Their goal was the center of life and things, their changeless background, a n d an inwar d certitude . Art had become mysticism. T h e spirit in whose mystery art was submerged was an earthly spirit, which the medieval alchemists had called Mercurius. H e is a symbol of the spirit tha t these artists divined or sought behind natur e and things, "behin d the Paintin g No . 1 , 1926.Co//ect/on. The Museum of Modern Art, New York appearanc e of nature. " Their mysticism was alien to Christianity, for tha t "Mercurial " spirit is alien to a "heavenly " spirit. Indeed , it was Christianity's dar k adversary tha t was forging its way in art. Her e we begin to see the real historical an d symbolic significance of "moder n art. " Like the hermeti c movements in the Middl e Ages, it must be understood as a mysticism of the spirit of earth, an d therefore as an expression of our time compensatory to Christianity. No artist sensed this mystic backgroun d of art mor e clearly or spoke of it with greate r passion than Kandinsky. Th e importanc e of the great works of art of all time did not lie, in his eyes, "o n the surface, in externals, but in the root of all roots — in the mystical content of art. " Therefor e he says: "Th e artist's eye should always be turned in upo n his inner life, and his ear should be always alert for the voice of inwar d necessity. This is the only way of giving expression to wha t the mystic vision commands. " Kandinsk y called his pictures a spiritual expression of the cosmos, a music of the spheres, a harmon y of colors an d forms. "Form, even if it is quit e abstrac t an d geometrical, has an inward clang; it is a spiritual being with effects that coincide absolutely with tha t form. " "Th e impac t of the acut e angle of a triangle on a circle is actually as overwhelming in effect as the finger of God touching the finger of Adam in Michelangelo. " In 1914, Fran z Mar c wrot e in his Aphorisms: "Matte r is a thing tha t ma n can at best tolerate ; he refuses to recognize it. Th e contemplation of the world has become the penetration of the world. Ther e is no mystic who, in his moments of sublimest rapture , ever attained the perfect abstraction of moder n thought, or took his soundings with a deepe r plummet. " Paul Klee, wh o ma y be regarded as the poet amon g moder n painters, says: "It is the artist's mission to penetrat e as far as ma y be toward tha t secret groun d wher e prima l law feeds growth. Whic h artist would not wish to dwell at the central organ of all motion in space-time (be it the brain or the heart of creation) from which all functions derive their life? In the womb of nature , in the prima l groun d of creation, wher e the secret key to all things lies hidden ? . . . Ou r beating heart drives us downward, far down to the prima l ground. " Wha t is encountered on this journe y "must be taken most seriously whe n it is perfectly fused wit h the appropriat e artistic means in visible form, " because, as Klee adds, it is not a question of merely reproducing wha t is seen; "th e secretly perceived is mad e visible." Klee's work is rooted in tha t prima l ground . "M y han d is entirely the instrument of a mor e distant sphere. Nor is it my head tha t functions in my work ; it is something else . . . . " In his work the spirit of'na - ture an d the spirit of the unconscious became inseparable. The y have drawn him an d draw us, the onlookers, into their magic circle. Klee's work is the most complex expression — now poetic, now demoni c — of the chthoni c spirit. Humo r an d bizarre ideas build a bridge from the realm of the dar k underworl d to the 263 huma n world ; the bond between his fantasy and the earth is the careful observation of the laws of natur e and the love for all creatures. "Fo r the artist, " he once wrote , "th e dialogue with natur e is the conditio sine qua non of his work. " A different expression of the hidden unconscious spirit can be found in one of the most notabl e of the younge r "abstract " painters, Jackson Pollock, an America n who was killed in a car accident whe n he was 44. His work has had a great influence on the younge r artists of our time. In My Painting, he revealed that he painted in a kind of trance : "Whe n I am in my painting I am not awar e of wha t I am doing. It is only after a sort of'ge t acquainted ' period that I see wha t I have been about. I have no fears about makin g changes, destroying the image , etc., because the painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come through. It is only when I lose contac t with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwis e there is pur e harmony , an easy give and take, an d the painting comes out well. " Pollock's pictures, which were painted prac - tically unconsciously, arc charged with bound - less emotiona l vehemence . In their lack of structur e they are almost chaotic, a glowing lava stream of colors, lines, planes, and points. The y may be regarded as a parallel to wha t the alchemists called the mass a confusa, the prima materia, or chaos — all ways of defining the precious prime matte r of the alchemical process, the starting point of the quest for the essence of being. Pollock's pictures represent the nothing tha t is everything—tha t is, the unconscious itself. The y seem to live in a time before the emergenc e of consciousness and being, or to be fantastic landscapes of a time after the extinction of consciousness and being. In the middl e ol our century, the purely ab - stract pictur e without any regula r orde r of forms and colors has become the most frequent expression in painting. Th e deepe r the dissolution of "reality, " the mor e the pictur e loses its symbolic content. Th e reason for this lies in the natur e of the symbol and its function. Th e symbol is an object of the known world hinting at something unknown ; it is the known expressing the life and sense of the inexpressible. But in merely abstract paintings, the world of the known has completely vanished. Nothing is left to form a bridge to the unknown . O n the othe r hand , these paintings reveal an unexpected background , a hidden sense. The y often turn out to be mor e or less exact images of natur e itself, showing an astounding similarity with the molecula r structur e of organic and inorgani c elements of nature . This is a perplexing fact. Pure abstraction has become an image of concrete nature . But Jun g ma y give us the key to understanding : "Th e deepe r layers of the psyche, " he has said, "lose their individua l uniqueness as they retreat farther and fartherintodarkness. 'Lowe r down," that is to say, as they approac h the autonomous functional systems, they become increasingly collective until they arc universalized and extinguished in the body's materiality, i.e. in chemical substances. Th e body's carbon is simply carbon. Henc e 'at bottom' the psyche is simply 'world.' A comparison of abstract paintings and microphotograph s shows tha t utter abstraction of imaginative art has in a secret an d surprising way become "naturalistic, " its subject being elements of matter. Th e "grea t abstraction " and the "grea t realism, " which parted at the beginning of our century, have come together again. We remembe r Kandinsky's words: "Th e poles open two paths, which both lead to one goal at the end. " This "goal, " the point of union, is reached in moder n abstract paintings. But it is attained completely unconsciously. The artist's intention plays no part in the process. This point leads to a most importan t fact about moder n art : Th e artist is, as it were, not so free in his creative work as he may think he is. If his work is performed in a mor e or less unconscious way, it is controlled by laws of natur e that, on the deepest level, correspond to the laws of the psyche, an d vice versa. T h e great pioneers of moder n art gave clearest expression to its true aims and to the depths from which the spirit rose that left its imprint on them. This point is important, though later artists, who may have failed to realize it, did not always plumb the same depths. Yet neither Kandinsky, nor Klee, nor an y othe r of the early masters of moder n painting, was ever awar e of the grave psychological dange r he was undergoing with the mystical submersion in the chthonic spirit and the prima l groun d of nature . That dange r must now be explained. As a starting point we ma y take anothe r aspect of abstract art. Th e Germa n writer Wilhelm Worringe r interpreted abstract art as the expression of a metaphysica l unease and anxiety tha t seemed to him to be mor e pronounce d amon g northern peoples. As he explained, they suffer from reality. Th e naturalness of the southern peoples is denied to them and they long for a super-real and super-sensual world to which they give expression in imaginative or abstract art. But. as Sir Herbert Rea d remarks in his Concise History of Modern Art, metaphysical anxiety is no longer only Germani c and northern ; it now characterizes the whole of the modern world. Rea d quotes Klee, who wrote in his Diary at the beginning of 1915: "Th e mor e horrifying this world becomes (as it is in these days) the mor e art becomes abstract; while a world at peace produce s realistic art. " T o Franz Marc , abstraction offered a refuge from the evil and ugliness in this world. "Ver y early in life I felt that ma n was ugly- Th e animals seemed to be mor e lovely and pure , yet even amon g them I discovered so muc h that was revolting and hideous tha t my painting became mor e and mor e schemati c an d abstract. " A good deal may be learned from a conversation that took place in 1958 between the Italian sculptor Marin o Marini and the writer Edouar d Roditi. Th e dominan t subject tha t Marini treated for years in man y variations is the nud e figure of a youth on a horse. In the early versions, which he described in the conversation as "symbols of hope and gratitude " (after the end of the Second World War), the rider sits his horse with outstretched arms, his The paintings of Jackso n Pollock (left, his/Vo 23) were painted in a trance (unconsciously ) as are the work s of other moder n artists—suc h asth e French "action " painter Georges Mathie u (far left). The chaoti c bu t powerfu l result may be compare d to the massa confusa of alchemy , and strangely resembles the hitherto hidde n forms of matter as revealed in microphotograph s (see p 22). Right, a similar configuration : a vibration pattern made by soun d wave s in glycerine. body bendin g slightly backward . In the course of years the treatmen t of the subject became mor e "abstract. " Th e mor e or less "classical " form of the rider gradually dissolved. Speaking of the feeling underlying this change , Marin i said: "If you look at my equestrian statues of the last 12 years in orde r of time , you will notice tha t the animal's pani c steadily increases, but tha t it is frozen with terror and stands paralyzed rathe r tha n rearing or taking flight. Tha t is all because I believe tha t we ar e approachin g the end of the world. In every figure, I strove to express a deepening fear an d despair. In this way I am attemptin g to symbolize the last stage of a dying myth, the myt h of the individual, victorious hero, of the humanist's ma n of virtue. " In fairy tale an d myth , the "victorious hero " is a symbol of consciousness. His defeat, as Marini says himself, mean s the deat h of the individual, a phenomeno n tha t appears in a social context as the submergenc e of the individual in the mass, an d in art as the decline of the huma n element. Whe n Roditi asked whethe r Marini's style was abandonin g the classical cano n on its way to becoming "abstract, " Marin i replied, "As soon as art has to express fear, it must of itself depart from the classical ideal. " He found subjects for his work in the bodies excavated at Pompeii. Roditi called Marini's art a "Hiro - shima style, " for it conjures u p visions of the end of a world. Marin i admitte d it. He felt, he said, as if he had been expelled from an earthly paradise . "Unti l recently, the sculptor aimed at full sensual an d powerful^forms. But for the last 15 years, sculptur e prefers forms in disintegration. " T h e conversation between Marin i and Roditi explains the transformation of'sensory " art into abstraction tha t should be clear to anyon e wh o has ever walked open-eyed through an exhibition of moder n art. Howeve r muc h he ma y appreciat e or admir e its formal qualities, he can scarcely fail to sense the fear, despair, aggression, and mockery tha t sounds like a cry from man y works. Th e "metaphysica l anxiety " that is expressed by the distress in these pictures 266 a n d sculptures ma y have arisen from the despair of a doome d world, as it did with Marini. In othe r cases, the emphasis ma y lie on the religious factor, on the feeling tha t God is dead. Ther e is a close connection between the two. At the root of this inne r distress lies the defeat (or rathe r the retreat) of consciousness. In the upsurge of mystical experience, everything tha t once boun d ma n to the huma n world, to earth, to time an d space, to matte r an d the natura l living of life, has been cast aside or dissolved. But unless the unconscious is balanced by the experienc e of consciousness, it will implacably reveal its contrar y or negative aspect. Th e wealth of creative sound tha t mad e the harmon y of the spheres, or the wonderful mysteries of the prima l ground , have yielded to destruction an d despair. In mor e tha n one case the artist has become the passive victim of the unconscious. In physics, too, the world of the backgroun d has revealed its paradoxica l nature ; the laws of the inmost elements of nature , the newly discovered structures an d relations in its basic unit, the atom, have become the scientific foundation for unprecedente d weapons of destruction, an d opened the way to annihilation. Ultimat e knowledge an d the destruction of the world are the two aspects of the discovery of the prima l groun d of nature . Jung , wh o was as familiar with the dangerous dua l natur e of the unconscious as with the T o p left and center, tw o sculptures by Marin o Marin i (190 1 -66) , fro m 194 5 and 1951 respectively, sho w h o w the them e of horse and rider w a s altered from an expression of tranquilit y t o one of tortured fear and despair, whil e the sculptures themselves gre w correspondingl y more and more abstract. Marini' s later wor k wa s influenced by the equally panic-stricken shapes of bodies foun d at Pompei i (left). importanc e of huma n consciousness, could offer mankin d only one weapon against catastrophe : the call for individua l consciousness, which seems so simple an d yet is so arduous. Consciousness is not only indispensable as a counterpoise to the unconscious, an d not only gives the possibility of meanin g to life. It has also an eminently practica l function. Th e evil witnessed in the world outside, in neighbors or neighboring peoples, can be mad e conscious as evil contents of our own psyche as well, an d this insight would be the first step to a radical chang e in our attitud e to our neighbors. Envy, lust, sensuality, lies, and all known vices are the negative, "dark " aspect of the unconscious, which can manifest itself in two ways. In the positive sense, it appears as a "spirit of nature, " creatively animatin g man , things, an d the world. It is the "chthoni c spirit " tha t has been mentioned so often in this chapter. I n the negative sense, the unconscious (that same spirit) manifests itself as a spirit of evil, as a drive to destroy. As has already been pointed out, the alchemists personified this spirit as "th e spirit Mercu - rius " an d called it, with good reason, Mercurius duplex (the two-faced, dua l Mercurius). In the religious languag e of Christianity, it is called the devil. But, howeve r improbabl e it may seem, the devil too has a dua l aspect. In the positive sense, he appears as Lucifer—literally, the light-bringer. Looked at in the light of these difficult and paradoxica l ideas, moder n art (which we have recognized as symbolic of the chthoni c spirit) also has a dua l aspect. In the positive sense it is the expression of a mysteriously profound nature-mysticism; in the negative, it can only be interpreted as the expression of an evil- or destructive spirit. Th e two sides belong together, for the parado x is one of the basic qualities of the unconscious an d its contents. T o prevent any misunderstanding, it must once mor e be emphasized tha t these considerations have nothing to do with artistic an d aesthetic values, but are solely concerned with the interpretation of moder n art as a symbol of our time. 267 Union of opposites Ther e is one mor e point to be made . Th e spirit of the age is in constant movement. It is like a river that flows on, invisibly but surely, and given the momentu m of life in our century, even 10 years is a long time. About the middl e of this century a change began to come over painting. It was nothing revolutionary, nothing like the change tha t happene d abou t 1910, which mean t the reconstruction of art to its very foundations. But there were groups of artists wh o formulated their aims in ways not hear d before. This transformation is going on within the frontiers of abstract painting. T h e representation of concrete reality, which springs from the prima l huma n need of catching the passing momen t on the wing, has become a truly concrete sensuous art in the photograph y of such me n as France's Henri CartierBresson, Switzerland's Werne r Bischof, an d others. We can therefore understan d why artists continued on their own way of inwardness and imagination. For a good man y of the young artists, however, abstrac t art as it had been practiced for man y years offered no adventure , no field of conquest. Seeking the new, they found it in wha t lay nearest, yet had been lost — in natur e and man . The y were not and are not concerned with the reproduction of natur e in pictures, but with the expression of their own emotiona l experience of nature . T h e French painte r Alfred Manessier defined the aims of his art in these words: "Wha t we have to reconque r is the weight of lost reality. We must make for ourselves a new heart, a new spirit, a new soul, in the measur e of man . Th e painter's true reality lies neither in abstraction nor in realism, but in the reconquest of his weight as a huma n being. At present non-figurative art seems to me to offer the one opportunity for the painte r to approac h the inward reality of himself and to grasp the consciousness of his essential self, or even of his being. It is only by the rcconquest of his position, I believe, tha t the painte r will be able, in the time to come , to return slowly to himself, to rediscover his own weight and so to strengthen it tha t it can even reach the outwar d reality of the world. " Jea n Bazaine speaks in similar terms: "It is a grea t temptatio n for the painte r of today to paint the pur e rhythm of his feeling, the most secret pulse of his heart, instead of embodyin g it in a concrete form. That , however, leads only to a desiccated mathematic s or a kind of abstract expressionism, which ends in monoton y a n d a progressive impoverishment of form. . . . But a form tha t can reconcile ma n with his world is an 'art of communion ' by which man , at any moment, can recognize his own unformed countenanc e in the world. " Wha t in fact artists now have at heart is a conscious reunion of their own inward reality with the reality of the world or of nature ; or, in the last resort, a new union of body and soul, matte r and spirit. Tha t is their way to the "re - conquest of their weight as huma n beings. " Onl y now is the great rift tha t set in with moder n art (between "grea t abstraction " and "grea t realism" ) being mad e conscious an d on the way to being healed. For the onlooker, this first becomes evident in the changed atmospher e in the works of these artists. Ther e radiates from the pictures of such artists as Alfred Manessier or the Belgian-born painte r Gustave Singier, in spite of all abstrac - tion, a belief in the world, and, in spite of all intensity of feeling, a harmon y of forms and colors tha t often attains serenity. In the French painte r Jean Lurcat's famous tapestries of the 2 6 8 In this century the depiction of actuality—once the province of the painter and sculptor—has been taken over by the photographer, whose camera can not only record but (like any landscape painting of past centuries) can express the photographer's own emotional experience of the subject. Right, a Japanese scene photographed by Werner Bischof (1916-54). 1950s the exuberanc e of natur e pervades the picture. His art could be called sensuous as well as imaginative . We find a serene harmon y of forms and colors also in the work of Paul Klee. This harmony was wha t he had always been striving for. Above all, he had realized the necessity of not denying evil. "Eve n evil must not be a triumphan t or degradin g enemy, but a powe r collaborating in the whole. " But Klee's starting point was not the same . H e lived nea r "th e dead and the unborn " at an almost cosmic distance from this world, while the younge r generation of painters can be said to be mor e firmly rooted in earth. An importan t point to notice is tha t moder n painting, just whe n it has advanced far enough to discern the union of the opposites, has taken up religious themes. Th e "metaphysica l void " seems to have been overcome . And the utterly unexpected has happened : Th e Churc h has become a patro n of moder n art. We need only mention here All Saints at Basle, with windows by Alfred Manessier; Assy church, with pictures by a large numbe r of moder n artists; the Matisse chapel at Vence ; and the churc h at Audincourt, which has works by Jea n Bazaine and the French artist Fernan d Leger. T h e admission of moder n art to the Churc h means mor e tha n an act of broadmindedness on the part of its patrons. It is symbolic of the fact tha t the part played by moder n art in relation to Christianity is changing. Th e compen - satory function of the old hermeti c movements has mad e way for the possibility of collaboration. In discussing the anima l symbols of Christ, it was pointed out tha t the light an d the chthonic spirits belonged to each other. It seems as if the momen t had come today whe n a new stage in the solution of this millennial problem might be reached. Wha t the future will yield we canno t know — whethe r the bridging of the opposites will give positive results, or whethe r the way will lead through yet mor e unimaginabl e catastrophes. Ther e is too muc h anxiety an d too muc h drea d at work in the world, and this is still the predominan t factor in art an d society. Above all, there is still too muc h unwillingness on the part of the individual to apply to himself and his life the conclusions tha t can be draw n from art, although he might be ready to accept them in art. Th e artist can often express man y things, unconsciously and without awakenin g hostility, which are resented whe n they are expressed by a psychologist (a fact tha t could be demonstrate d even mor e conclusively in literatur e than in the visual arts). Confronted by the statements of the psychologist, the individua l feels directly challenged; but wha t the artist has to say, particu270 larly in our century, usually remains in an impersona l sphere. And yet it seems importan t tha t the suggestion of a mor e whole, an d therefore mor e human , form of expression should have become visible in our time. It is a glimme r of hope , symbolized for me (at the time of writing : 1961) by a numbe r of paintings by the French artist Pierre Soulages. Behind a catarac t of huge , black rafters there glimmers a clear, pur e blue or a radian t yellow. Light is dawn - ing behind darkness. Mid-20th-centur y art seems to be movin g awa y fro m a Marini-lik e despair—a s is seen in the gesture of Jea n Lurcat, wh o exhibited his wor k in a field (top left), a link wit h nature and the earth.

Symbols in an individual analysis Jolande Jacob! A 1 7th-centur y engravin g of "Th e Palace of Dreams." i The beginning of the analysis Ther e is a widespread belief tha t the methods of Jungia n psychology are applicabl e only to middle-aged people. True , man y me n an d wome n reach middl e age without achieving psychological maturity , an d it is therefore necessary to help them throug h the neglected phases of their development. The y have not completed the first part of the process of individuation tha t Dr. M.-L. von Fran z has described. But it is also true tha t a young person can encounte r serious problems as he grows up. If a young person is afraid of life an d finds it hard to adjust to reality, he might prefer to dwell in his fantasies or to remai n a child. In such a young person (especially if he is introverted) one can sometimes discover unexpected treasures in the unconscious, and by bringing them into consciousness strengthen his ego and give him the psychic energy he needs to grow into a matur e person. Tha t is the function of the powerful symbolism of our dreams. Othe r contributors to this book have described the natur e of these symbols and the role they play in man's psychological nature . I wish to show how analysis can aid the individuation process by taking the exampl e of a youn g engineer, aged 25, whom I shall call Henry . Henr y came from a rura l district in eastern Switzerland. His father, of Protestant peasant stock, was a general practitioner: Henr y described him as a ma n with high mora l standards, b ut a rathe r withdrawn person wh o found it difficult to relate to othe r people. He was mor e of a father to his patients tha n to his children. At home , Henry's mothe r was the dominan t personality. "W e were raised by the strong han d of our mother, " he said on one occasion. She came from a family with an academi c backgroun d and wide artistic interests. She herself, in spite of her strictness, ha d a broa d spiritual horizon; she was impulsive an d romanti c (she had a great love for Italy). Thoug h she was by birth a Catholic , her children ha d been brough t u p in the Protestantism of their father. Henr y ha d a sister, older tha n himself, with whom he had a good relationship. Henr y was introverted, shy, finely drawn , a n d very tall, with light hair, a high pale forehead, an d blue eyes with dar k shadows. He did not think tha t neurosis (the most usual reason) had brough t him to me , bu t rathe r a n inne r urge to work on his psyche. A strong mothertie, however, an d a fear of committin g himself to life wer e hidden behind this urge ; but these were only discovered durin g the analytical work with me . H e had just completed his studies and taken a position in a large factory, an d he was facing the man y problems of a young ma n on the threshold of manhood . "It appears to me, " he wrote in a letter asking for an interview, "tha t this phase of my life is particularly importan t an d meaningful. I must decide either to remai n unconscious in a well-protected security, or else to ventur e on a yet unknown way of which I have grea t hopes. " Th e choice thus confronting him was whethe r to remain a lonely, vacillating, an d unrealistic youth or to become a self-sufficient an d responsible adult. Henr y told me tha t he preferred books to society; he felt inhibited amon g people, and was often tormente d by doubts and self-criticism. He was well read for his age an d had a leaning toward aesthetic intellectualism. After an earlier atheistic stage, he became rigorously Protestant, but finally his religious attitude became completely neutral. H e had chosen a technical education because he felt his talents lay in mathematic s and geometry. He possessed a logical mind , trained in the natura l sciences, but he also ha d a propensity toward the irrational an d mystical tha t he did not wan t to admit even to himself. Abou t two years before his analysis began, Henr y ha d become engaged to a Catholi c girl from the French part of Switzerland. He described her as charming , efficient, and full of 274 Symbols in an individual analysis initiative. Nevertheless, he was uncertain whethe r he should undertak e the responsibility of marriage . Since he had so little acquaintanc e with girls, he thought it might be better to wait, or even to remain a bachelor dedicated to a scholarly life. His doubts were strong enough to prevent his reaching a decision; he needed a further step toward maturit y before he could feel sure of himself. Although qualities of both'his parents were combined in Henry , he was markedly motherbound. In his consciousness,'he was identified with his real (or "light" ) mother, wh o repre - sented high ideals and intellectual ambitions. But in his unconscious he was deeply in the power of the dark aspects of his mother-boun d condition. His unconscious still held his ego in a strangle-hold. All his clear-cut thinking and his efforts to find a firm standpoint in the purely rational remained nothing mor e than an intellectual exercise. T h e need to escape from this "motherprison" was expressed in hostile reactions to his real mothe r and a rejection of the "inne r mother " as a symbol of the feminine side of the unconscious. But an inne r powe r sought to hold him back in the condition of childhood, resisting everything tha t attracted him to the outside world. Even the attractions of his fiancee were not enough to free him from his mother-ties, an d thus help him find himself. He was not awar e tha t his inne r urge for growth (which he felt strongly) included the need to detach himself from his mother. My analytical work with Henr y lasted nine months. Altogether, there were 35 sessions in which he presented 50 dreams. So short an analysis is rare. It is only possible when energyladen dreams like Henry's speed u p the process of development. Of course, from the Jungia n point of view, there is no rule for the length of time required for a successful analysis. All depends on the individual's readiness to realize inner facts an d on the materia l presented by his unconscious. Like most introverts, Henr y led a rathe r monotonous oute r life. Durin g the day he was completely involved in his job . In the evenings he sometimes went out with his fiancee or with friends, with whom he liked to have literary discussions. Quit e often he sat in his lodgings absorbed in a book or in his own thoughts. Thoug h we regularly discussed the happenings of his daily life, an d also his childhood and youth, we usually got fairly quickly to the investigation of his dreams an d the problems his inner life presented to him. It was extraordinary to see how strongly his dreams emphasized his "call " to spiritual development. But I must mak e it clear tha t not everything described here was told to Henry . In analysis one must always remain conscious of how exLeft, the palace and monastery of Escorial, Spain, built by Philip II about 1 56 3 Its fortress structure images the introvert's withdrawa l fro m the worl d Below, a drawin g by Henry of a barn he built as a child wit h fortress-like battlements. 2 7 5 plosive the dreamer's dream symbols ma y be for him. The analyst can hardly be too careful and reserved. If too bright a light is thrown on the dream-languag e of symbols, the dreame r can be driven into anxiety, an d thus led into rationalization as a defense mechanism. O r he can no longer assimilate them, and can fall into a severe psychic crisis. Also, the dreams reported and commente d on here ar c by no means all the dreams tha t Henr y had durin g his analysis. I can discuss only an importan t few that influenced his development. In the beginning of our work, childhood memorie s with importan t symbolic meanings came up. The oldest date d back to Henry's fourth year. He said: "On e mornin g I was allowed to go with my mothe r to the baker's shop and there I received a crescent roll from the baker's wife. I did not eat the roll but carried it proudly in my hand . Onl y my mothe r and the baker's wife were present, so I was the only man. " Such crescents are popularly called "moon-teeth, " and this symbolic allusion to the moon underlines the dominatin g powe r of the feminine a powe r to which the little boy may have felt exposed an d which, as the "only man, " he was prou d of being able to confront. Anothe r childhood memor y came from his fifth year. It concerned Henry's sister, who came home after he r examinations at school and found him constructing a toy barn . Th e barn was mad e with blocks of wood arrange d in the form of a squar e and surrounde d with a kind of hedge tha t looked like the battle - ments of a castle. Henr y was pleased with his achievement, and said teasingly to his sister: "Yo u have started school but you'r e already on holiday. " He r reply, tha t he was on holiday all year, upset him terribly. He felt deeply hurt tha t his "achievement " was not taken seriously. Even years later Henr y had not forgotten the bitter hurt an d injustice tha t he had felt when his construction was rejected. His later problems concerning the assertion of his masculinity and the conflict between rational an d fantasy values are already visible in this early experience. And these problems are also to be seen in the images of his first dream. 2 7 6 The initial dream T h e da y after Henry's first visit to me , he had the following dream : I was on an excursion with a group of people I did not know. We were going to the Zinalrothorn. We had started from Samaden. We only walked about an hour because we were to camp and have some theatricals. I was not given an active part. I especially remember one performer —a young woman in a pathetic role wearing a long flowing robe. It was midday and I wanted to go on to the pass. As all the others preferred to remain, I went up alone, leaving my equipment behind. However, I found myself right back in the valley and completely lost my orientation. I wanted to return to my party but did not know which mountainside I should climb. I was hesitant about asking. Finally, an old woman showed me the way I must go. Then I ascended from a different starting point than our group had used in the morning. It was a matter of making a turn at the right altitude and then following the mountain slope to return to the party. I climbed 'along a cogwheel mountain railway on the right side. On my left little cars constantly passed me, each containing one hidden bloated little man in a blue suit. It is said they are dead. I was afraid of other cars coming from behind and kept turning around to look, so as not to be run over. My anxiety was needless. At the point where I had to turn off. to the right, there were people awaiting me. They took me to an inn. A cloudburst came up. I regretted that my equipment my rucksack, and my motor bike—were not there, but I was told not to get them till next morning. I accepted the advice. One of Henry's childhoo d memories involved a crescent roll, whic h he dre w (top left). Center, the same shape on a modern Swis s bakery sign. The crescent shape has long been linked wit h the moo n and thus wit h the feminine principle, as in the crow n (left) of the goddes s Ishtar of third-centur y B.C. Babylon . Dr. Jun g assigned grea t importanc e to the first dream in a n analysis, for, according to him, it often has anticipatory value. A decision to go into analysis is usually accompanie d by an emotiona l upheava l tha t disturbs the deep psychic levels from which archetypa l symbols arise. Th e first dreams therefore often present "collective images " tha t provide a perspective for the analysis as a whole an d can give the therapist insight into the dreamer's psychic conflicts. Wha t does the above dream tell us of Henry's future development ? We must first examine some of the associations tha t Henr y himself supplied. Th e village of Samade n ha d been the home of Jiir g Jenatsch , a famous 17th-century Swiss freedom-fighter. Th e "theatricals " called u p the though t of Goethe's Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre, which Henr y liked very much . In the woma n he saw a resemblanc e to the figure in a painting called The Island of Ihe Dead by the 19th-century Swiss artist Arnold Bocklin. T h e "wise old woman, " as he called her, seemed to be associated on the one han d to his analyst, on the othe r to the charwoma n in J. B. Priestley's play They Came to a City. Th e cog-wheel railway reminde d him of the bar n (with battlements) tha t he had built as a child. T h e dream describes an "excursion " (a sort of "walkin g tour"), which is a striking parallel to Henry's decision to undertak e analysis. Th e individuation process is often symbolized by a voyage of discovery to unknown lands. Such a voyage takes place in Joh n Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, or in Dante's Divina Commedia. Th e "traveler " in Dante's poem, searching for a way, comes to a mountai n tha t he decides to climb. But because of thre e strange animals (a motif tha t will also appea r in one of Henry's later dreams) he is forced to descend into the valley an d even into hell. (Late r he ascends again to purgator y an d finally reaches para - dise.) From this parallel one could deduc e tha t 277 The initial stage of the process of individuatio n can sometimes be a period of disorientation—a s wa s the case wit h Henry. Left, the first woodcu t from the 1 5th century book The Dream of Poliphilo show s the dreamer fearfully entering a dark woo d —perhap s representing his entrance into the unknown . Associations produced by Henry to his first dream: right, Island of the Deadby the 19th-centur y Swis s artist Arnol d Bocklin. Far right, a scene from the 194 4 Londo n productio n of J . B. Priestley's They Came to a City, whic h concerns the reactions of a grou p of people from many walk s of life to an "ideal city." One of the central characters is a charwoman , left of picture. there might be a similar period of disorientation and lonely seeking in store for Henry . The first part of this life-journey, represented as climbing a mountain , offers ascent from the unconscious to an elevated point of view of the ego i.e. to an increased consciousness. Samade n is name d as the starting point of the excursion. This is wher e Jenatsc h (whom we ma y take as embodyin g the "freedom-seeking " sense within Henry's unconscious) started his campaig n for the liberation of the Veltlin region of Switzerland from the French. Jenatsc h had othe r characteristics in commo n with Henry : H e was a Protestant wh o fell in love with a Catholi c girl; and, like Henry, whose analysis was to free him from his motherties and from fear of life, Jenatsc h also fought for liberation. On e could interpre t this as a favorable augur y for the success of Henry's own fight for freedom. Th e goal of the excursion is the Zinalrothorn , a mountai n in western Switzerland that he did not know. Th e word rol ("red" ) in Zinalro/horn touches on Henry's emotional problem. Red is usually symbolic of feeling or passion; here it points to the value of the feeling-function, which was insufficiently developed in Henry . An d the word "horn " reminds one of the crescent roll in the baker's shop of Henry's childhood. After a short walk, a halt is called, and Henr y can return to a state of passivity. This also belongs to his nature . Th e point is underlined by the "theatricals. " Attendin g the theatr e (which is an imitation of real life) is a popula r way of evading a n active part in life's drama . The spectator can identify with the play, yet continue to pande r to his fantasies. This kind of identification permitted the Greeks to experience catharsis, muc h as the psycho-drama initiated by the American psychiatrist J. L. Moren o is now used as a therapeuti c aid. Some such process ma y have enabled Henr y to underg o an inne r development whe n his associations raised memorie s of Wilhelm Meisler, Goethe's story of the maturin g of a young man . Tha t Henr y should have been impressed by the romanti c appearanc e of a woma n is also not surprising. This figure resembles Henry's mothe r an d is at the same time a personification of his own unconscious feminine side. Th e connection Henr\ makes between her and Bocklin's Island of Ihe Dead points to his depressive mood, so well expressed by the painting, which shows a white-robed priest-like figure steering a boa t bearing a coffin toward an island. We have here a significant double paradox : Th e keel of the boat seems to suggest a contrary course, away from the island; and the "priest " is a figure of uncertain sex. In Henry's associations, this figure is certainly hermaphroditic . Th e doubl e parado x coincides with Henry's ambivalence : Th e opposites in 2 7 8 his soul are still too undifferentiated to be clearly separated. After this interlude in the dream. Henr y suddenly becomes awar e tha t it is noon and he must go on. So he again starts for the pass. A mountai n pass is a well-known symbol for a "situation of transition" tha t leads from an old attitude of mind to a new one . Henr y must go alone ; it is essential for his ego to surmoun t the test unaided. Thus he leaves his kit behind an action that signifies tha t his menta l equip - ment has become a burden , or tha t he must change his norma l way of going abou t things. But he does not reach the pass. He loses his bearings and finds himself back in the valley. This failure shows tha t while Henry's ego decides on activity, his othe r psychic entities (represented by the othe r members of the party) remain in the old state of passivity an d refuse to accompan y the ego. (Whe n the dreame r himself appears in a dream, he usually represents only his conscious ego ; the othe r figures stand for his mor e or less unknown , unconscious qualities.) Henr y is in a situation wher e he is helpless, yet ashamed to admit it. At this momen t he meets an old woma n wh o indicates the right way to him. He can do nothing but accept her advice. The helpful "old woman " is a well-known symbol in myths an d fairy talcs for the wisdom of the eternal female nature . Th e rationalist Henr y hesitates to accept her help because such acceptanc e requires a sacrificium intelleclus—a sacrifice, or discarding, of a rational way of thought. (This deman d will often be mad e of Henr y in later dreams.) Such a sacrifice is unavoidable ; it applies to his relationship with the analysis as well as with everyday life. He associated the figure of the "old woman " to the charwoma n in Priestley's play about a new "dream " city (perhaps an analogy to the New Jersusalem of the Apocalypse) into which the characters can enter only after a kind of initiation. This association seems to show that Henr y had intuitively recognized this confrontation as something decisive for him. Th e charwoma n in Priestley's play says tha t in the city "the y have promised me a room of my own. " There she will be self-reliant an d independent, as Henr y seeks to be. If such a technically minded young ma n as Henr y is consciously to choose the way of psychic development, he must be prepared for a reversal of his old attitudes. Therefore , on the advice of the woman , he must start his climb from a different spot. Onl y then will it be possible for him to judge at wha t level he must deviate to reach the grou p — the othe r qualities of his psyche tha t he had left behind. 1 le climbs a cog-wheel rail\va\ track a motif perhaps reflecting his technical education) and *79 keeps to the right side of the track —which is the conscious side. (In the history of symbolism, the right side generally represents the realm of consciousness; the left, the unconscious.) From the left, little cars ar e comin g down , an d in each a little ma n is hidden. Henr y is afraid tha t an unnoticed upward-boun d car might hit him from the rear. His anxiety proves groundless, but it reveals tha t Henr y is afraid of what, so to speak, lies behind his ego. T h e bloated, blue-clothed men might symbolize sterile intellectual thoughts tha t ar e being brought down mechanically. Blue often denotes the function of thinking. Thu s the men might be symbols of ideas or attitude s tha t have died on the intellectual heights wher e the air is too thin. The y could also represent lifeless inner parts of Henry's psyche. A commen t on these men is mad e in the dream : "It is said they ar e dead. " But Henr y is alone. Wh o makes this statement ? It is a voice — and whe n a voice is heard in a dream it is a most meaningful occurrence . Dr. Jun g identified the appearanc e of a voice in dreams with an intervention of the Self. It stands for a knowledge tha t has its roots in the collective fundaments of the psyche. Wha t the voice says cannot be disputed. T h e insight Henr y has gained abou t the "dead " formulas, to which he has been too committed , marks a turnin g point in the dream. He has at last reached the right place for taking a new direction, to the right (the conscious direction), toward the conscious and the outer world. Ther e he finds the people he left behind waiting for him; an d thus he can become conscious of previously unknown aspects of his personality. Since his ego has surmounte d the dangers it confronted alone (an accomplishment that could mak e him mor e matur e and stable), he can rejoin the grou p or "collective " a n d get shelter and food. The n comes the rain, a cloudburst tha t relaxes tension an d makes the earth fertile. In mythology, rain was often thought to be a "love-union " between heaven an d earth. In the Eleusinian mysteries, for instance, after everything had been purified by water, the call went u p to heaven : "Le t it rain! " and down to Left, the Greek maiden Danae, wh o w a s impregnated by Zeus in the form of a shower of gol d (from a painting by the 1 6th century Flemish artist J an Gossaert) Like Henry's dream, this myt h reflects the symbolism of the cloudburs t as a sacred marriage betwee n heaven and earth. In another of Henry's dreams a do e appears - an image of shy femininit y as is the faw n in the painting, right, by the 19th centur y British artist Edwi n Landseer earth : "Be fruitful!" This was understood as a sacred marriage of the gods. In this way rain can be said to represent a "solution " in the literal sense of the word. Comin g down , Henr y again meets the collective values symbolized by the rucksack and motorcycle. He has passed through a phase in which he has strengthened his ego-consciousness by proving he can hold his own, an d he has a renewed need for social contact. However, he accepts the suggestion of his friends that he should wait and fetch his things the next morning. Thu s he submits for the second time to advice tha t comes from elsewhere : the first time, to the advice of the old woman , to a subjective power, an archetypa l figure; the second time, to a collective pattern . Wit h this step Henr y has passed a milestone on the road to maturity. As an anticipation of the inne r development that Henr y could hope to achieve through analysis, this dream was extraordinarily promising. Th e conflicting opposites tha t kept Henry s soul in tension were impressively symbolized. O n the one hand , there was his conscious urge to ascend, an d on the othe r his tendency to passive contemplation. Also, the image of the patheti c young woma n in her white robes (representing Henry's sensitive and romanti c feelings) contrasts with the bloated corpses in blue suits (representing his sterile intellectual world). However, to overcome these obstacles an d bring abou t a balanc e between them would be possible for Henr y only after the most severe trials. Fear of the unconscious T h e problems we encountered in Henry's initial dream showed u p in man y others problems like vacillation between masculine activity and feminine passivity, or a tendency to hide behind intellectual asceticism. He feared the world, yet was attracted to it. Fundamentally , he feared the obligations of marriage , which demande d tha t he form a responsible relationship with a woman . Such an ambivalenc e is not unusua l for someone on the threshold of manhood . Thoug h in terms of age Henr y had left tha t phase behind him, his inner maturity did not matc h his years. This problem is often me t in the introvert, with his fear of reality and oute r life. T h e fourth dream tha t Henr y recounted provided a striking illustration of his psychological state : It seems to me that I have had this dream endless times. Military service, long-distance race. Alone I go on my way. I never reach the goal. Will I be the last? The course is well known to me, all of it deja vu. The start is in a little wood, and the ground is covered with dry leaves. The terrain slopes gently to an idyllic little brook that invites one to tarry. Later, there is a dusty country road. It leads toward Hombrechtikon, a small village near the upper lake of Zurich. A brook bordered by willows similar to a painting of Bocklin's in which a dreamy female figure follows the course of the water. Night falls. In a village I ask for directions to the road. I am told the road leads on for seven hours over a pass. I gather myself together and go on. However, this time the end of the dream differs. After the willow-bordered brook I get into a wood. There I discover a doe that runs away. I am proud of this observation. The doe has appeared on the left side and now I turn to the right. Here I see three strange creatures, hall pig, half dog, with the legs of a kangaroo. The faces are quite undifferentiated, with large drooping dog ears. Maybe they are costumed people. As a boy, I once masqueraded in the circus costume of a donkey. 2 8l The beginning of the dream is conspicuously like Henry's initial dream. A dreamlike female figure again appears, an d the setting of the dream is associated with anothe r painting by Bocklin. This painting, called Autumn 'Thoughts, and the dry leaves mentioned earlier in the dream underline the autumna l mood. A romanti c atmospher e also reappears in this dream. Apparentl y this inner landscape , repre - senting Henry's melancholy, is very familiar to him. Again he is in a collective of people, but this time with military comrade s on a longdistance race. This whole situation (as the military service also suggests) might be regarded as a representation of an average man's fate. Henr y himself said: "It's a symbol of life." But the dreame r does not wan t to adjust to it. He goes on alone - which was probabl y always the case with Henry. Tha t is why he has the impression tha t everything is dejci vu. His thought ("I never reach the goal" ) indicates strong feelings of inferiority an d a belief that he cannot win the "long-distanc e race. " His way leads to Hornbrechtikon, a name tha t reminds him of his secret plans to break away from home (Horn = home , brechen = to break). But becaus e this breaking away does not occur, he again (as in the initial dream) loses his sense of orientation an d must ask for directions. Dreams compensat e mor e or less explicitly for the dreamer's conscious attitud e of mind. T h e romantic , maidenly figure of Henry's conscious ideal is balanced by the appearanc e of the strange , female-like animals. Henry's world of instincts is symbolized by something feminine. Th e wood is a symbol of an unconscious area , a dark place wher e animals live. At first a doe — a symbol of shy, fugitive, innocent womanliness — emerges, but only for a moment. The n Henr y sees three mixed-up animals of a strange and repulsive appearance . They seem to represent undifferentiated instinctuality — a sort of confused mass of his instincts, containing the raw materia l for a later development. Their most striking characteristic is that they are all virtually faceless, and thus without the slightest glimmerings of consciousness. In the minds of man y people, the pig is closely associated to dirty sexuality. (Circe, for example , change d the men who desired her into swine.) Th e dog ma y stand for loyalty, but also for promiscuity, because it shows no discrimination in its choice of partners. Th e kangaroo, however, is often a symbol for motherliness and tende r carrying capacity. All these animals present only rudimentar y traits, and even these ar e senselessly contaminated. In alchemy, the "prime material " was often represented by such monstrous an d fabulous creature s mixed forms of animals. In psychological terms, they would probably symbolize the original total unconsciousness, out of which the individual ego can rise an d begin to develop toward maturity. Left, Henry' s drawin g of the strange animal s of his dream. They are mut e and blind, unable to communicate , and so represent his unconsciou s state The animal o n the groun d (whic h he colored green, the color of vegetation and nature, and in folk lore a symbol of hope ) hints at possibilities of growt h and a chance of differentiation. Henry's fear of the monsters becomes evident by his attemp t to mak e them seem harmless. He wants to convince himself tha t they are only dressed-up people, like himself in a boyhood masquerade . His anxiety is natural. A m a n discovering such inhuma n monsters in his inner self, as symbols of certain traits of his unconscious, has every reason to be afraid. Anothe r dream also shows Henry's fear of the depths of the unconscious: I am a cabin boy in a sailing boat. Paradoxically, the sails are spread, though there is a complete calm. My task consists of holding a rope that serves to fasten a mast. Strangely enough, the railing is a wall covered with stone slabs. This whole structure lies exactly on the border betwren the water and the sailing boat that floats there alone. I hold fast to the rope (not to the mast) and I am forbidden to look into the water. In this dream Henr y is in a psychological borderline situation. The railing is a wall that protects him but at the same time obstructs his view. He is forbidden to look into the wate r (where he might discover unknown powers). All these images reveal his doub t and fear. The ma n wh o fears the communication s of his inner depths (like Henry ) is as muc h afraid of the feminine element in himself as he is of real women . At one momen t he is fascinated by her, at anothe r he tries to escape ; fascinated and terrified, he flees so as not to become her "prey. " He does not dar e to approac h a beloved (and therefore idealized) partne r with his animal-like sexuality. As a typical result of his mother-tie , Henr y had difficulty in giving both feeling and sensuality to the same woman . Again and again his dreams brought proof of his desire to free himsell from this dilemma In on e dream he was a "mon k on a secret mission. " In another, his instincts tempted him into a brothel: Together with a military comrade who has had many erotic adventures I find myself waiting in front of a house on a dark street in an unknown city. Entrance is permitted only to women. Therefore, in the hall, my friend puts on a little carnival mask of a woman's face and goes up the stairs. Possibly I did the same as he, but I do not remember clearlv. What this dream proposes would satisfy Henry's curiosity — but only at the price of a fraud. As a ma n he lacks the courage to enter the house, which is obviously a brothel. But if he divests himself of his masculinity, he might gain an insight into this forbidden world forbidden by his conscious mind. Th e dream, however, does not tell us whethe r he decides to enter. Henr y had not yet overcome his inhibitions an understandabl e failure if we consider the implications of going into the brothel. The above dream seemed to me to reveal a homoeroti c strain in Henry : He appeare d to feel that a feminine "mask " would mak e him The pig like animal of the dream connote s bestiality and lustfulness — as in the myt h of Circe, wh o turned men into swin e Abov e left, from a Greek vase, a pig-man , Odysseus, and Circe, Right, in one of the cartoons by George Grosz attacking pre war German society, a ma n (wit h a prostitute) is given a pig's head to sho w his vulgarit y attractive to men . This hypothesis wa s sup - ported by the following dream : The saint and the prostitute I find myself back in rny fifth or sixth year. My playmate of those days tells me how he participated in an obscene act with the director of a factory. My friend laid his right hand on the man's penis to keep it warm and at the same time to warm his own hand. The director was an intimate friend of my father's whom I venerated for his broad and varied interests. But he was laughed at by us as an "eternal youth." For children of tha t age homoeroti c play is not unusual. Tha t Henr y still came to it in his drea m suggests tha t it wa s loaded with guilt feelings, an d therefore strongly repressed. Suc h feelings wer e linked to his dee p fear abou t forming a lasting tie with a woman . Anothe r drea m a n d its associations illustrated this conflict: I take part in the wedding of an unknown couple. At one in the morning the little wedding party returns from the festivities—the bridal couple, the best man, and the maid of honor. They enter a large courtyard where I await them. It seems that the newlyweds have already had a quarrel, as well as the other couple. They finally find the solution by having the two men and the two women retire separately. Henr y explained : "Yo u see her e th e wa r of the sexes as Giraudou x describes it. " An d then he added : "Th e palac e in Bavaria , wher e I remembe r seeing this dream-courtyard , has until lately been disfigured by emergenc y housing for poo r people . Whe n I visited there , I asked myself if it woul d not be preferabl e to eke out a poor existence in the ruins of classic beaut y tha n to lead a n active life surrounde d by th e ugliness of a grea t city. I also asked myself whe n I was a witness at the weddin g of a comrad e whethe r his marriag e would last, for his brid e mad e a n unfavorabl e impression on me. " T h e longing to withdra w into passivity an d introversion, the fear of a n unsuccessful marriage, the dream's separatio n of th e sexes — all these ar e unmistakabl e symptoms of the secret doubts hidde n beneat h Henry's consciousness. Henry's psychic condition was most impressively depicted in the following dream, which exposed his fear of primitive sensuality an d his desire to escape into a kind of asceticism. I n it one ca n see the direction his developmen t was taking. For this reason the drea m will be interprete d a t greate r length. I find myself on a narrow mountain road. On the left (going down) there is a deep abyss, on the right a wall of rock. Along the road there are several caves, shelters, cut out of the rock, as protection from the weather for lonely wanderers. In one of these caves, half hidden, a prostitute has taken refuge. Strangely, I see her from behind, from the rock side. She has a formless, spongy body. I look at her with curiosity and touch her buttocks. Perhaps, it suddenly seems to me, she is not a woman but a kind of male prostitute. This same creature comes then to the fore as a saint with a short crimson coat thrown around his shoulders. He strides down the road and goes into another, much larger cave fitted with roughhewn chairs and benches. With a haughty look he drives out all those already present, also me. Then he and his followers move in and establish themselves. T h e persona l association tha t Henr y contribute d to the prostitut e was the "Venu s of Willendorf," a little carved figure (from the paleo284 litliic age) of a fleshy woman , probably a natur e or fertility goddess. The n he adde d : " I first heard tha t touching the buttocks is a fertility rite when I was on a tour through the Wallis [a canto n in French Switzerland ], wher e I visited ancient Celtic graves an d excavations. Ther e I was told tha t ther e was once a smooth sloping surface of tiles smeared with all kinds of substances. Infertile wome n had to slide down on their bar e buttocks in orde r to cure their sterility. " T o the coat of the "saint, " Henr y associated this: "M y fiancee owns a jacke t of similar shape , but it's white. O n the evening before the dream we wer e out dancing , an d she was wearing this white jacket. Anothe r girl, who is her friend, was with us. She had a crimson jacket tha t I liked better. " If dreams are not wish-fulfillments (as Freud taught) but rather, as Jun g assumed, "self-representations of the unconscious, " then we must admit that Henry's psychic condition could hardly be better represented than in the description given in the "saint " dream. Henr y is a "lonely wanderer " on the narrow path. But (perhaps thanks to analysis)" he is already on his way down from inhospitable heights. T o the left, on the side of the unconscious, his road is bordered by the terrifying depths of an abyss. O n the right side, the side of consciousness, the way is blocked by the rigid rock wall of his conscious views. However, in the caves (which might represent, so to speak, unconscious areas in Henry's field of consciousness) there are places wher e refuge can be found whe n bad weathe r comes in other words, whe n outside tensions become too threatening. T h e caves are the result of purposeful huma n work: cut into the rock. In a way they resemble the gaps tha t occur in our consciousness when our powe r of concentration has reached its limits an d is broken, so tha t the stuff of fantasy can penetrat e without restraint. At such times something unexpected can reveal itself and allow a dee p insight into the background of the psyche a glimpse into the unconscious regions wher e our imagination has free play. Moreover, rock caves ma y be symbols of the wom b of Mothe r Earth , appearin g as mysterious caverns in which transformation a n d rebirth can come about. Thu s the dream seems to represent Henry's introverted withdrawa l —when the world becomes too difficult for him - into a "cave " within his consciousness wher e he can succumb to subjective fantasies. This interpretation would also explain why he seeks the female figure - Left, Henry' s drawin g of the boat of his dream, wit h a stone wal l for a railing—anothe r image of his introversion and fear of life Right, the prehistoric sculpture know n as the "Venu s of Willendorf" - one of Henry' s associations to the image of the prostitute in his dream. In the same dream, the saint is seen in a sacred cave. Man y actual caves are holy places —lik e the Cave of Bernadette (far right) at Lourdes, wher e a vision of the Virgin Mar y appeared to a girl. 285 a replica of some of the inne r feminine traits of his psyche. She is a formless, spongy, halfhidden prostitute representing the repressed image in his unconscious of a woma n whom Henr y would never have approache d in conscious life. She would always have been strictly taboo to him in spite of the fact tha t (as the opposite of a too-much-venerated mother) the prostitute would have a secret fascination for him —as for every son with a mother-complex. T h e idea of restricting a relationship with a woma n to a purely animal-like sensuality, excluding all feelings, is often enticing to such a young man . In such a union he can keep his feelings split off, an d thus can remai n "true " to his mothe r in an ultimat e sense. Thus, in spite of everything, the taboo set by the mothe r against every othe r woma n remains inflexibly effective in the psyche of the son. Henry , wh o seems to have withdrawn totally to the backgroun d of his fantasy-cave, sees the prostitute only "from behind. " He dares not look her in the face. But "from the back " also means from her least huma n side her buttocks (i.e. the part of her body tha t will stimulat e the sensual activity of the male). By touching the buttocks of the prostitute, Henr y unconsciously carries out a kind of fertility rite, similar to the rites tha t ar e practiced in man y primitive tribes. Th e laying on of hands an d healing often go together; in the same way, touching with the han d can be either a defense or a curse. Immediatel y the idea arises that the figure is not a woma n after all but a mal e prostitute. T h e figure thus becomes hermaphroditic , like man y mythological figures (and like the "priest " figure of the first dream). Insecurity concerning his own sex can often be observed in a pubescent individual; and for this reason homosexuality in adolescence is not considered unusual. Nor is such uncertainty exceptional for a young m a n with Henry's psychological structure ; he had already implied this in some of his earlier dreams. But repression (as well as sexual uncertainty) may have caused the confusion abou t the sex of the prostitute. Th e female figure tha t has A coat can often symbolize the outer mask or persona that one presents to the world . The mantle of the prophet Elijah bore a similar meaning : Whe n he ascended to heaven (left, in a Swedis h peasant painting), he left the mantle behind for his successor Elisha Thu s the mantle represented the prophet' s powe r and role, to be assumed by his successor (In the painting the mantle is red, like the saint'scoa t in Henry's dream.) both attracted and repelled the dreame r is transformed first of all into a ma n and then into a saint. Th e second transformation eliminates everything sexual from the image , and implies that the only mean s of escape from the reality of sex lies in the adoption of an ascetic and holy life, denyin g the flesh. Such dramati c reversals are commo n in dreams: Something turns into its opposite (as the prostitute becomes a saint) as if to demonstrat e that by transmuta - tion even extreme opposites can change into each other. Henr y also saw something significant in the saint's coat. A coat is often a symbol of the protective cover or mask (which Jung called the persona) that an individual presents to the world. It has two purposes: first, to make a specific impression on othe r people : second, to conceal the individual's inne r self from their prying eyes. Th e persona tha t Henry's dream gives the saint tells us something abou t his attitude to his fiancee and her friend. Th e saint's coat has the color of the friend's jacket, which Henr y had admired , but it also had the shape of his fiancee's coat. This may imply that Henry's unconscious wante d to confer the quality of saintliness on both women , in orde r to protect himself against their womanl y attrac - tiveness. Also, the coat is red, which (as has been noted before) is traditionally the symbolic color of feeling an d passion. It thus gives the saint figure a kind of eroticized spirituality — a quality tha t is frequently found in men who repress their own sexuality an d try to rely solely on their "spirit " or reason. Such an escape from the world of the flesh, however, is unnatura l in a young person. In the first half of life, we should learn to accept our sexuality : It is essential to the preservation a n d continuation of our species. Th e dream seems to be remindin g Henr y of just this point. Whe n the saint leaves the cave and walks down the road (descending from the heights toward the valley), he enters a second cave with rough-hewn benches and chairs, which reminds one of the early Christians' places of worship an d refuge from persecution. This cave seems to be a healing, holy place a place of meditation and of the mystery of transformation from the earthly to the heavenly, from the carna l to the spiritual. Henr y is not permitted to follow the saint, but is turned out of the cave with all those present (that is, with his unconscious entities). Seemingly. Henr y and all the others who are not followers of the saint ar e being told that they must live in the outside world. Th e dream seems to say that Henr y must first succeed in oute r life before he will be able to immers e himself in a religious or spiritual sphere. Th e figure of the saint also seems to symbolize (in a relatively undifferentiated, anticipatory fashion) the Self; but Henr y is not yet matur e enough to stay in the immediat e vicinity of this figure. Henry's touchin g the prostitute can be related to the belief in the magical effect of a touch : Left, the 17t h centur y Irishman Valentine Greatrakes, famou s for healing by laying o n of hands Right, another example of the persona The clothin g wor n by rebellious British "beatnik" youth s in the 1960s indicated the values and wa y of life that they wante d to display to the outer world . How the analysis developed In spite of an initial skepticism an d resistance, Henry began to take a lively interest in the inner happenings of his psyche. He was obviously impressed by his dreams. The y seemed to compensat e for his unconscious life in a mean - ingful way and to give him valuabl e insights into his ambivalence , his vacillation, and his preference for passivity. After a time mor e positive dreams appeare d that showed tha t Henr y was already "well on his way. " Tw o month s after his analysis had begun he reported this dream : In the harbor of a little place not far from my home, on the shore of a lake in the neighborhood, locomotives and freight cars are being raised from the bottom of the lake where they had been sunk in the last war. First a large cylinder like a locomotive boiler is brought up. Then an enormous, rusty freight car. The whole picture presents a horrible yet romantic sight. The recovered pieces have to be transported away under the rails and cables of the nearby railway station. Then the bottom of the lake changes into a green meadow. Her e we see wha t a remarkabl e inner ad - vance Henr y has made . Locomotives (probably symbols of energy and dynamism) have been "sunk " —i.e. repressed into the unconscious — but are now being brought into the light of day. With them are freight cars, in which all kinds of valuabl e cargo (psychic qualities) can be transported. Now tha t these "objects " have again become availabl e for Henry's conscious life, he can begin to realize how muc h active powe r could be at his disposal. Th e transformation of the dark lake bottom into a meadow underlines his potential for positive action. Sometimes, on Henry's "lonely journey " towar d maturity, he also received help from his feminine side. In his 24th dream he meets a "humpbacke d girl" : I am on the way to a school together with an unknown young lady of small and daintv appearance but disfigured by a hump. Many other people also go into the schoolhouse. While the others disperse to different rooms for singing lessons, the girl and I sit at a little square table. She gives me a private singing lesson. I feel an impulse of pity for her and therefore kiss her on the mouth. I am conscious, however, that by this act I am unfaithful to my fiancee- even though it may be excusable. Singing is one of the immediat e expressions of feelings. But (as we have seen) Henr y is afraid of his feelings; he knows them only in an idealized adolescent form. Nevertheless, in this dream he is taught singing (the expression of feelings) at a squar e table. Th e table, with its four equal sides, is a representation of the "fourfoldness" motif, usually a symbol of completeness. Thus the relation between singing As in the painting, left (by the 19th century British artist Willia m Turner), entitled Rain, Steam, and Speed, the locomotive is clearly an image of driving, dynami c energy In Henry'sdrea m (whic h hedrew , below) , locomotives are raised out of a lake — an expression of the release of a potential for valuable action that had previously been repressed into his unconsciou s and the squar e table seems to indicate that Henr y must integrat e his "feeling" side before he can achieve psychic wholeness. In fact, the singing lesson does move his feelings, and he kisses the girl on her mouth . Thereb y he has, in a sense, "espoused " her (otherwise he would not feel "unfaithful"); he has learned to relate to "th e woma n within. " Anothe r dream demonstrate s the part that this little humpbacke d girl had to play in Henry's inner development: I am in an unknown boys" school. During the instruction period I secretly force my way into the house. I don't know for what purpose. I hide in the room behind a little square closet. The door to the corridor is half open. I fear being detected. An adult goes by without seeing me. But a little humpbacked girl comes in and sees me at once. She pulls me out of my hiding place. Not only does the same girl appea r in both dreams, but both appearance s take place in a schoolhouse. In each instance Henr y must learn something to assist his development. Seemingly, he would like to satisfy his desire for knowledge while remainin g unnoticed and passive. The figure of a deformed little girl appears in numerou s fairy tales. In such tales the ugliness of the hum p usually conceals grea t beauty, which is revealed when the "right man " comes to free the girl from a magic spell —often by a kiss. Th e girl in Henry's dream may be a symbol of Henry's soul, which also has to be released from the "spell " that has mad e it ugly. Whe n the humpbacke d girl tries to awaken Henry's feelings by song, or pulls him out of his dark hiding place (forcing him to confront the light of dayi , she shows herself as a helpful guide. Henr y can an d must in a sense belong simultaneously to both his fiancee and the little humpbacke d girl (to the first as a representative of the real, oute r woman , and to the second as the embodimen t of the inner psychic anima). 2 8 9 The oracle dream People wh o rely totally on their rationa l thinking an d dismiss or repress every manifestation of their psychic life often have a n almost inexplicable inclination to superstition. The y listen to oracles an d prophecie s an d can be easily hoodwinked or influenced by magicians an d conjurers. An d becaus e dreams compensat e one's oute r life, the emphasis such people pu t on their intellect is offset by dreams in which they mee t the irrationa l an d canno t escape it. Henr y experienced this phenomeno n in the course of his analysis, in a n impressive way. Fou r extraordinar y dreams, based on such irrational themes, represented decisive milestones in his spiritual development. Th e first of these came abou t 10 weeks after the analysis began. As Henr y reported the dream : Alone on an adventurous journey through South America, I feel, at last, the desire to return home. In a foreign city situated on a mountain I try to reach the railway station, which I instinctively suspect to be in the center of the town at its highest level. I fear I may be too late. Fortunately, however, a vaulted passage breaks through the row of houses on my right, built closely together as in the architecture of the Middle Ages, forming an impenetrable wall behind which the station is probably to be found. The whole scene offers a very picturesque aspect. I see the sunny, painted facades of the houses, the dark archway in whose shadowy obscurity four ragged figures have settled down on the pavement. With a sigh of relief, I hurry toward the passage—when suddenly a stranger, a trappertype, appears ahead of me evidently filled with the same desire to catch the train. At our approach the four gatekeepers, who turn out to be Chinese, jump up to prevent our passage. In the ensuing fight my left leg is injured by the long nails on the left foot of one of the Chinese. An oracle has to decide now whether the way could be opened to us or whether our lives must be forfeited. I am the first to be dealt with. While my companion is bound and led inside, the Chinese consult the oracle by using little ivory sticks. The judgment goes against me, but I am given another chance. I am fettered and led aside, just as my companion was, and he now takes my place. In his presence, the oracle has to decide my fate for the second time. On this occasion it is in my favor. I am saved. O n e immediately notices the singularity an d the exceptional meanin g of the dream, its wealth of symbols, and its compactness. However, it seemed as if Henry's conscious min d wante d to ignore the dream. Because of his skepticism toward the products of his unconscious it was importan t not to expose the dream to the dange r of rationalization, but rathe r to let it act on him without interference. So I refrained a t first from my interpretation. Instead I offered only one suggestion: I advised him to read an d then to consult (as did .the Chinese figures in his dream) the famous Chinese oracle book, the / Ching. T h e / Ching, the so-called "Book of Changes, " is a very ancient book of wisdom; its roots go back to mythica l times, an d it comes to us in its present form from 3000 B.C . According to Richar d Wilhelm (who translated it into Germa n an d provided a n admirabl e commen - tary), both of the mai n branche s of Chinese philosophy—Taoism an d Confucianism—have their commo n origin in the / Ching. Th e book is based on the hypothesis of the oneness of m a n an d the surroundin g cosmos, an d of the complementar y pairs of opposites Yan g and Yin (i.e. the mal e an d female principles). It consists of 64 "signs " each represented by a drawin g mad e u p of six lines. I n these signs are contained all the possible combinations of Yan g a n d Yin. Th e straight lines ar e looked upo n as male , the broken lines as female. Eac h sign describes changes in the huma n or cosmic situation, an d each prescribes, in a 290 pictorial language , the course of action to be followed at such times. Th e Chinese consulted this oracle by mean s tha t indicated which of the signs was relevant at a given moment. The y did so by using 50 small sticks in a rathe r complicated way tha t yielded a given number. (Incidentally, Henr y said tha t he ha d once read — probabl y in Jung's commentar y on "Th e Secret of the Golden Flower"—o f a strange game sometimes used by the Chinese to find out abou t the future.) Toda y the mor e usual metho d of consulting the / Ching is to use thre e coins. Each throw of the three coins yields one line. "Heads, " which stands for a mal e line, count as three ; "tails, " a broken female line, count as two. T h e coins are thrown six times, and the numbers tha t are produce d indicat e the sign or hexagram (i.e. the set of six lines) to be consulted. But wha t significance has such "fortune telling " for our own time ? Even those wh o accept the idea tha t the / Ching is a storehouse of wisdom will find it har d to believe tha t consultation of the oracle is anythin g mor e tha n an experiment in the occult. It is indeed difficult to grasp tha t mor e is involved, for the ordinary person today consciously dismisses all divining technique s as archai c nonsense. Yet they are not nonsense. As Dr. Jun g has shown, they ar e based on wha t he calls the "principl e of synchronicity" for, mor e simply, meaningful coincidence). He has described this difficult new idea in his essay "Synchronicity : An Acausal Connecting Principle. " It is based on the assumption of an inne r unconscious knowledge tha t links a physical event with a psychic condition, so tha t a certain event tha t appears "accidental " or "coincidental " can in fact be psychically meaningful; an d its meanin g is often symbolically indicated throug h dreams tha t coincide with the event. Several weeks after having studied the / Ching, Henr y followed my suggestion (with considerable skepticism) and threw the coins. Wha t he found in the book had a tremendous impac t on him. Briefly, the oracle to which he referred bore several startling references to his dream, an d to his psychological condition generally. By a remarkabl e "synchronistic " coincidence , the sign tha t was indicated by the coinpatter n was called MENG - or "Youthful Folly. " Left, tw o pages of the / Ching showin g the hexagram MEN G (whic h stands for "youthfu l folly"). The t o p three lines of the hexagram symbolize a mountain , and can also represent a gate; the botto m three lines symbolize water and the abyss. Right, Henry's drawin g of the swor d and helmet that appeared to him in a fantasy, and that also related to a section of the / Ching — Li, "th e clinging , fire." In this chapte r there are several parallels to the dream motifs in question. According to the text of the / Ching, the three uppe r lines of this hexagram symbolize a mountain , an d have the meanin g of ''keeping still" ; they can also be interpreted as a gate . Th e thre e lower lines symbolize water, the abyss, an d the moon. All these symbols have occurred in Henry's previous dreams. Amon g man y othe r statements tha t seemed to apply to Henr y was the following warning : "Fo r youthful folly, it is the most hopeless thing to entangl e itself in empt y imaginings. Th e mor e obstinately it clings to such unrea l fantasies the mor e certainly will humilia - tion overtake it. " In this and othe r complex ways, the oracle seemed to be directly relevant to Henry's problem. This shook him. At first he tried to suppress its effect by willpower, but he could not escape it or his dreams. Th e message of the / Clung seemed to touch him deeply in spite of the puzzling language in which it was expressed. He became overpowered by the very irrationality whose existence he ha d so long denied. Sometime s silent, sometimes irritated, reading the words tha t seemed to coincide so strongly with the symbols in his dreams, he said, " I must think all this over thoroughly, " an d he left before our session was up. He canceled his next session by telephone , because of influenza, an d did not reappear. I waited '"keepin g still") because I supposed tha t he might not yet have digested the oracle. A mont h went by. Finally Henr y reappeared , excited and disconcerted, and told me wha t had happene d in the meantime . Initially his intellect (which he had until then relied upo n so much) had suffered a great shock — an d one tha t he had at first tried to suppress. However, he soon had to admit tha t the communication s of the oracle were pursuing him. He had intended to consult the book again, because in his dream the oracle had been consulted twice. But the text of the chapte r "Youthful Folly" expressly forbids the puttin g of a second question. For two nights Henr y had tossed sleeplessly in bed ; but on the third a luminous dream image of great powe r had suddenly appeare d before his eyes: a helmet with a sword floating in empt y space. Henr y immediately took u p the / Ching again an d opened it at random to a commen - tary on Chapte r 30, wher e (to his grea t surprise) he read the following passage : "Th e clinging is fire, it means coats of mail, helmets, it means lances and weapons. " Now he felt tha t he understood why a second intentiona l consulting of the oracle was forbidden. For in his dream the ego was excluded from the second question; it was the trappe r wh o had to consult the oracle the second time. In the same way, it was Henry's semi-unconscious action tha t had unintentionally asked the second question of the / Ching by opening the book at random an d coming upo n a symbol tha t coincided with his nocturna l vision. Henr y was clearly so deeply stirred tha t it seemed time to try to interpre t the dream tha t had sparked the transformation. In view of the events of the dream, it was obvious tha t the dream-elements should be interpreted as contents of Henry's inne r personality an d the six dream-figures as personification of his psychic qualities. Such dreams are relatively rare , but whe n they do occur their after-effects are all the mor e powerful. Tha t is why they could be called "dreams of transformation. " Wit h dreams of such pictorial power, the dreame r seldom has mor e tha n a few personal associations. All Henr y could offer was tha t he had recently tried for a jo b in Chile, and had been refused because they would not employ unmarrie d men. He also knew tha t some Chinese let the nails of their left han d grow as a sign tha t instead of working they have given themselves over to meditation. Henry's failure (to get a job in South America ! was presented to him in the dream. In it he is transported into a hot southern Right, a parallel to the gatekeepers of Henry' s "oracle dream": one of a pair of sculptures (1 Oth-1 3th century ) that guard the entrance to China' s Mai-chi-sa n caves. 2 9 2 world — a world that, in contrast to Europe , he would call primitive, uninhibited, and sensual. It represents an excellent symbolic picture of the realm of the unconscious. This realm was the opposite of the cultivated intellect and Swiss puritanism tha t ruled Hen - ry's conscious mind. It was, in fact, his natura l "shadow land, " for which he had longed; but after a while he did not seem to feel too comfortable there. From the chthonic . dark, materna l powers (symbolized by South America) he is drawn back in the dream to the light, personal mothe r an d to his fiancee. He suddenly realizes how far he has gone awa y from them ; he finds himself alone in a "foreign city. " This increase in consciousness is symbolized in the dream as a "highe r level" ; the city was built on a mountain . So Henr y "climbe d up " to a greate r consciousness in the "shadow land" ; from there he hoped "t o find his way home. " This problem of ascending a mountai n had already been put to him in his initial dream. And , as in the dream of the saint an d the prostitute, or in man y mythological tales, a mountai n often symbolizes a place of revelation, wher e transformation and change may take place. T h e "city on the mountain " is also a wellknown archetypa l symbol that appears in the history of our cultur e in man y variations. Th e city, corresponding in its groun d plan to a mandala , represents tha t "region of the soul " in the middl e of which the Self (the psyche's innermost cente r an d totality) has its abode . Surprisingly, the seat of the Self is represented in Henry's dream as a traffic center of the huma n collective — a railway station. This may be because the Self (if the dreame r is young and has a relatively low level of spiritual development) is usually symbolized by an object from the realm of his personal experience often a bana l object, which compensate s the dreamer's high aspirations. Onl y in the matur e person acquainte d with the images of his soul is the Self realized in a symbol tha t corresponds to its uniqu e value. Even though Henr y does not actually know wher e the station is, he nevertheless supposes it to be in the center of the city, on its highest point. Here , as in earlier dreams, he receives help from his unconscious. Henry's conscious mind was identified with his profession as an engineer, so he would also like his inner world to relate to rational products of civilization, like a railway station. Th e dream, however, rejects this attitud e an d indicates a completely different way. T h e way leads "under " and through a dark arch. An arched gateway is also a symbol for a threshold, a place wher e dangers lurk, a place that at the same time separates and unites. Instead of the railway station tha t Henr y was looking for, which was to connec t uncivilized South Americ a with Europe , Henr y finds himself before a dark arched gateway wher e four ragged Chinese, stretched on the ground , block the passage. Th e dream makes no distinction between them, so they ma y be seen as four still undifferentiated aspects of a mal e totality. (The numbe r (bur, a symbol of wholeness an d com2 9 3 pleteness, represents an archetyp e tha t Dr. Jun g has discussed at length in his writings.) T h e Chinese thus represent unconscious male psychic parts of Henr y tha t he cannot pass, because the "wa y to the Self" (i.e. to the psychic center) is barre d by them an d must still be opened to him. Until this issue has been settled he canno t continue his journey . Still unawar e of the impendin g danger, Henr y hurries to the gateway, expecting at last to reach the station. But on his way he meets his "shadow " — his unlived, primitive side, which appears in the guise of an earthy, rough trapper. Th e appearanc e of this figure probably means tha t Henry's introverted ego has been joined by his extraverted (compensatory) side, which represents his repressed emotiona l an d irrationa l traits. This shadow figure pushes itself past the conscious ego into the foreground, and , because it personifies the activity an d autonomy of unconscious qualities, it becomes the prope r carrier of fate, through whom everything happens. T h e dream moves toward its climax. Durin g the fight between Henry , the trapper, an d the four ragged Chinese, Henry's left leg is scratched by the long nails on the left foot of one of the four. (Here , it seems, the Europea n characte r of Henry's conscious ego has collided with a personification of the ancient wisdom of the East, with the extreme opposite of his ego. T h e Chinese come from an entirely different psychic continent, from an "othe r side " tha t is still quit e unknown to Henr y an d tha t seems dangerous to him.) T h e Chinese can also be said to stand for the "yellow earth" ; for the Chinese people are related to the earth as few people are. An d it is just this earthy, chthoni c quality tha t Henr y had to accept. Th e unconscious mal e totality of his psyche, which he me t in his dream, had a chthoni c materia l aspect tha t his intellectual conscious side lacked. Thu s the fact tha t he recognized the four ragged figures as Chinese shows tha t Henr y had gained an increase of inner awareness concerning the natur e of his adversaries. Henr y had heard tha t the Chinese sometimes let the nails of their left han d grow long. But in the dream the long nails are on the left foot; they are, so to speak, claws. This ma y indicate tha t the Chinese have a point of view so different from Henry's tha t it injures him. As we Below , a drawin g by a patient under analysis depict s a black monster (on the red or "feeling " side) and a Madonna-lik e woma n (on the blue or spiritual side). This wa s Henry's position: over-emphasi s on purity, chastity, etc. and fear of the irrational unconscious . (Bu t note that the green, mandala-like flower acts as a link betwee n the opposin g sides.) Belo w left, another patient's painting depicting his insomnia — caused by his repressing to o strongl y his passionate, red, instinctual drives (whic h may overwhel m his consciousness ) by a black "wall " of anxiety and depression. know, Henry's conscious attitud e toward the chthoni c an d feminine, toward the materia l depths of his nature , was most uncertain an d ambivalent. This attitude , symbolized by his "left leg" (the point of view or "standpoint " of his feminine, unconscious side of which he is still afraid), was harme d by the Chinese. This "injury, " however, did not itself bring abou t a change in Henry . Every transformation demand s as its precondition "th e ending of a world " — the collapse of an old philosophy of life. As Dr. Henderso n has pointed out earlier in this book, at ceremonies of initiation a youth must suffer a symbolic deat h before he can be reborn as a ma n an d be taken into the tribe as a full member. Thu s the scientific, logical attitude of the enginee r must collapse to mak e room for a new attitude . I n the psyche of an engineer, everything "irrational " ma y be repressed, and therefore often reveals itself in the dramati c paradoxe s of the dream-world . Thu s the irrationa l appeare d in Henry's dream as an "oracl e game " of foreign origin, with a fearful an d inexplicable powe r to decide huma n destinies. Henry's ratirna l ego ha d no alternative but to surrende r unconditionally in a real sacrificium intellectus. Yet the conscious min d of such an inexperienced, immatur e person as Henr y is not sufficiently prepare d for such an act. H e loses the turn of fortune, an d his life is forfeit. H e is caught, unabl e to go on in his accustomed way or to return home — to escape his adult responsibilities. (It was this insight for which Henr y had to be prepare d by this "grea t dream." ) Next, Henry's conscious, civilized ego is boun d an d pu t aside while the primitive trap - per is allowed to take his place an d to consult the oracle. Henry's life depend s on the result. But whe n the ego is imprisoned in isolation, those contents of the unconscious tha t are personified in the shadow-figure ma y bring help a n d solution. This becomes possible whe n one recognizes the existence of such contents an d has experienced their power. The y can then become our consciously accepted constant companions. Because the trappe r (his shadow) wins the game in his place, Henr y is saved. Facing the irrational Henry's subsequent behavior clearly showed tha t the dream (and the fact tha t his dreams a n d the oracle book of the / Ching ha d brought him to face deep an d irrationa l powers within himself) had a very deep effect on him. From then on he listened eagerly to the communica - tions of his unconscious, an d the analysis took on a mor e an d mor e agitated character. Th e tension tha t until then had threatened the depths of his psyche with disruption came to the surface. Nevertheless, he courageously held to the growing hope tha t a satisfactory conclusion would be reached. Barely two weeks after the oracle dream (but before it was discussed and interpreted), Henr y h a d anothe r dream in which he was once again confronted with the disturbing problem of the irrational: Alone in my room. A lot of disgusting black beetles crawl out of a hole and spread out over my drawing table. I try to drive them back into their hole by means of some sort of magic. I am successful in this except for four or five beetles, which leave my table again and spread out into the whole room. I give up the idea of following them further; they are no longer so disgusting to me. I set fire to the hiding place. A tall column of flame rises up. I fear my room might catch fire, but this fear is unfounded. By this time, Henr y ha d become relatively skilful in the interpretation of his dreams, so he tried to give this dream an explanation of his own. He said : "Th e beetles are my dar k qualities. The y were awakene d by the analysis and come u p now to the surface. Ther e is a dange r tha t they ma y overflow my professional work (symbolized by the drawin g table). Yet I did not dar e to crush the beetles, which reminde d me of a kind of black scarab, with my han d as I first intended, an d therefore ha d to use 'magic ' In setting fire to their hiding place I, 295 so to speak, call for the collaboration of something divine, as the upshooting column of flame makes me think of the fire tha t I associate with the Ark of the Covenant. " T o go deepe r into the symbolism of the dream, we must first of all note that these beetles are black, which is the color of darkness, depression, and death . In the dream, Henr y is "alone " in his room a situation that can lead to introversion an d corresponding states of gloom. In mythology, scarab beetles often appea r golden ; in Egypt they were sacred animals symbolizing the sun. But if they ar c black, they symbolize the opposite side of the sun something devilish. Therefore . Henry's instinct is quit e correct in wantin g to fight the beetles with magic. Thoug h lour or five of the beetles remain alive, the decrease in the numbe r of beetles is enough to free Henr y from his fear an d disgust. He then tries to destroy their breeding ground by fire. This is a positive action, because fire can symbolically lead to transformation an d rebirth (as, for instance, it does in the ancient myth of the phoenix). In his waking life, Henr y now seemed full of enterprising spirit, but apparentl y he had not yet learned to use it to the right effect. There - fore, I wan t to consider another, later dream that throws an even clearer light on his problem. This dream presents in symbolic language Henry s fear of a responsible relationship with a woma n and his tendency to withdraw from the feeling side of life: Above , an Egyptian relief (c 1 30 0 B.C.) show s a scarab beetle and the g o d Amo n withi n the circle of the sun. In Egypt the golde n scarab wa s itself a symbol of the sun. Below, a guite different kind of insect, more like the "devilish" beetles of Henry's dream: an engraving by the 1 9th-centur y artist James Ensor of humans wit h dark, repulsive insect bodies. An old man is breathing his last. He is surrounded by his relatives, and I am among them. More and more people gather in the large room, each one characterizing himself through precise statements. There are a good 40 persons present. The old man groans and mutters about "unlived life." His daughter, who wants to make his confession easier, asks him in what sense "unlived" is to be understood; whether cultural or moral. I he old man will not answer. His daughter sends me to a small adjoining room where I am to find the answer by telling a fortune with cards. The "nine" that I turn up will give the answer, according to the color. 2 9 6 I expect to turn up a nine at the very beginning, but at first I turn up various kings and queens. I am disappointed. Now I turn up nothing but scraps of paper that don't belong to the game at all. Finally, I discover that there are no more cards in the deck but only envelopes and other pieces of paper. Together with my sister, who is also present, I look everywhere for the cards. Finally I discover one under a textbook or a notebook. It is nine, a nine of spades. It seems to me that this can only mean one thing: that it was moral chains that prevented the old man from "living his life." T h e essential message of this strange dream was to war n Henr y wha t awaited him if he failed to "live his life." Ih e "old man " probably represents the dying "rulin g principle" - the principle tha t rules Henry's consciousness, but whose natur e is unknown to him. Th e 40 people present symbolize the totality of Henry's psychic traits (40 is a numbe r of totality, an elevated form of the numbe r four). Tha t the old ma n is dying could be a sign tha t part of Henry's mal e personality is on the verge of a final transformation. T h e daughter's query abou t the possible cause of deat h is the unavoidabl e an d decisive question. Ther e seems to be an implication tha t the old man's "morality " has prevented him from living out his natura l feelings an d drives. Yet the dying ma n himself is silent. Therefor e his daughte r (the personification of the mediating feminine principle , the anima ) has to become active. She sends Henr y to discover the answe r from the fortune-telling cards — the answe r tha t will be given by the color of the first nine turned up. T h e fortune telling has to take place in an unused, remot e room (revealing how far away such a happenin g is from Henry's conscious attitude). He is disappointed whe n at first he uncovers only kings an d queens (perhaps collective images of his youthful veneration for powe r and wealth]. This disappointmen t becomes intense when the picture-cards run out, for this shows that the symbols of the inne r world have also been exhausted. Onl y "scraps of paper " are left, without an y images. Thu s the source of pictures dries u p in the dream. Henr y then has to accept the help of his feminine side (this time represented by his sister) to find the last card. Togethe r with her, he finally finds a card — the nine of spades. It is this card tha t must serve to indicat e by its color wha t the phrase "unlived life" mean t in the dream. And it is significant tha t the card is hidden unde r a textbook or notebook - which probabl y represents the arid intellectual formulas of Henry's technical interests. T h e nine has been a "magi c number " for centuries. According to the traditiona l symbolism of numbers, it represents the perfect form of the perfected Trinit y in its threefold elevation. An d there are endless othe r meanings associated with the numbe r nine in various ages a n d cultures. Th e color of the nine of spades is the color of death an d of lifelessness. Also, the "spade " image strongly brings to mind the form of a leaf, an d therefore its blackness emphasizes tha t instead of being green, vital, an d natura l it is now dead. Furthermore , the word "spade " derives from the Italian spada, which means "sword " or "spear. " Such weapons often symbolize the penetrating, "cutting " function of the intellect. Thu s the dream makes it clear tha t it was the "mora l bonds " (rathe r than "cultural" ) tha t did not allow the old ma n to "live his life." In Henry's case, these "bonds " probably were his fear of surrendering fully to life, of accepting responsibilities to a woma n an d thereby becoming "unfaithful " to his mother. Th e dream has declared that the "unlived life" is an illness of which one can die. Henr y could no longer disregard the message of this dream. He realized tha t one needs something mor e tha n reason as a helpful compass in the entanglements of life; it is necessary to seek the guidanc e of the unconscious powers tha t emerge as symbols out of the depths of the psyche. Wit h this recognition, the goal of this part of his analysis was reached. H e now knew tha t he was finally expelled from the paradis e of an uncommitte d life an d tha t he could never return to it. 297 Above, a phoeni x reborn in flames (from a medieval Arabi c manuscript) — a well-know n example of the motif of death and rebirth by fire. Below, a woodcu t by the 19th - century French artist Grandville reflects some of the symboli c value of playing cards The Spades suit, for instance, in French Piques, is symbolicall y linked wit h the "penetrating" intellect and, by its black color, wit h death. The final dream A further dream came to confirm irrevocably the insights Henr y had gained. After some unimportan t short dreams tha t concerned his everyday life, the last dream (the 50th in the series) appeare d with all the wealth of symbols tha t characterize s the so-called "grea t dreams. " Four of us form a friendly group, and we have the following experiences: Evening: We are sitting at a long, raw-lumber table and drinking out of each of three different vessels: from a liqueur glass, a clear, yellow, sweet liqueur; from a wine glass, dark red Campari; from a large, classically shaped vessel, tea. In addition to us there is also a girl of reserved, delicate nature. She pours her liqueur into the tea. Night: We have returned from a big drinking bout. One of us is the President de la Republique Franchise. We are in his palace. Walking out onto the balcony we perceive him beneath us in the snowy street as he, in his drunken condition, urinates against a mound of snow. His bladder content seems to be inexhaustible. Now he even runs after an old spinster who carries in her arms a child wrapped in a brown blanket. He sprays the child with his urine. The spinster feels the moisture but ascribes it to the child. She hurries away with long steps. Morning: Through the street, which glistens in the winter sun, goes a Negro: a gorgeous figure, completely naked. He walks toward the east, toward Berne (that is, the Swiss capital). We are in French Switzerland. We decide to go to pay him a visit. Noon: After a long automobile trip through a lonely snowy region we come to a city, and into a dark house where the Negro is said to have put up. We are very much afraid that he might be frozen to death. However, his servant, who is just as dark, receives us. Negro and servant are mute. We look into the rusksacks we have brought with us, to see what each could give the Negro as a gift. It must be some sort of object characteristic of civilization. I am the first to make up my mind and I take a package of matches from the floor and offer it to the Negro with deference. After all have presented their gifts, we join with the Negro in a happy feast, a joyous revel. Even at first glanc e the dream with its four parts makes an unusua l impression. It encompasses a whol e da y an d moves toward the "right, " in the direction of growing consciousness. Th e movemen t starts with the evening, goes over into the night, an d ends at noon, whe n the sun is at its zenith. Thu s the cycle of the "day " appears as a totality pattern. In this dream the four friends seem to symbolize the unfolding masculinity of Henry's psyche, an d their progress through the four "acts " of the dream has a geometric patter n tha t reminds one of the essential construction of the mandala . As they first came from the east, then from the west, moving on toward the "capital " of Switzerland (i.e. the center), they seem to describe a patter n tha t tries to unit e the opposites in a center. An d this point is underlined by the movemen t in time — the descent into the night of the unconsciousness, following the sun's circuit, which is followed by an ascent to the bright zenith of consciousness. T h e dream begins in the evening, a time whe n the threshold of consciousness is lowered a n d the impulses an d images of the unconscious c a n pass across it. I n such a condition (when the feminine side of ma n is most easily evoked) it is natura l to find tha t a female figure joins the four friends. She is the anima figure tha t belongs to them all ("reserved an d delicate, " remindin g Henr y of his sister) and connects them all to each other. O n the table stand three vessels of different character, which by their concave form accentuat e the receptiveness tha t is symbolic of the feminine. Th e fact tha t these vessels are used by all present indicates a mutua l an d close relatedness amon g them. Th e vessels differ in form (liqueur glass, wine glass, a n d a classically formed container) an d in the color of their contents. Th e opposites into which these fluids divide—sweet an d bitter, red a n d yellow, intoxicating an d sobering—ar e all intermingled, throug h being consumed by each of the five persons present, who sink into an unconscious communion . T h e girl seems to be the secret agent, the catalyst wh o precipitates events (for it is the role of the anima to lead a ma n into his UP. conscious, and thus to force him to deeper recollection and increased consciousness). It is almost as though with the mixing of liqueur and tea the party would approac h its climax. T h e second part of the dream tells us more of the happenings of this "night. " Th e four friends suddenly find themselves in Paris (which, for the Swiss, represents the town of sensuality, of uninhibited joy and love). Her e a certain differentiation of the four takes place, especially between the ego in the dream (which is to a great extent identified with the leading thinking function) and the "President de la Re - publique, " who represents the undeveloped and unconscious feeling function. T h e ego (Henry and two friends, who may be considered as representing his semi-conscious functions) looks down from the height of a balcony on the President, whose characteristics are exactly wha t one would expect to find in the undifferentiated side of the psyche. He is unstable, and has abandone d himself to his instincts. H e urinates on the street in a drunken state ; he is unconscious of himself, like a person outside civilization, following only his natura l anima l urges. Thu s the President symbolizes a great contrast to the consciously accepted standards of a good middle-class Swiss scientist. Onl y in the darkest night of the unconscious could this side of Henr y reveal itself. However, the President-figure also has a very positive aspect. His urine (which could be the symbol of a stream of psychic libido) seems inexhaustible. It gives evidence of abundance , of creative and vital strength. (Primitives, for instance, regard everything coming from the body — hair, excrement, urine, or saliva—as creative, as having magical powers.) This unpleasant 299 Prcsidcnt-imagc , therefore, could also be a sign of the powe r an d plenty tha t often adhere s to the shadow side of the ego. Not only does he urinat e without embarrassment, but he runs after an old woma n wh o is holding a child. This "old spinster " is in a way the opposite or complemen t of the shy, fragile anima of the first part of the dream. She is still a virgin, even though old and seemingly a mother; in fact, Henr y associated her to the archetypa l image of Mar y with the child Jesus. But the fact that the baby is wrappe d in a brown (earth-colored) blanket makes it seem to be the chthonic , earthboun d counter-image of the Savior rathe r than a heavenly child. Th e President, wh o sprinkles the child with his urine , seems to perform a travesty of baptism. If we take the child as a symbol of a potentiality within Henr y tha t is still infantile, then it could receive strength through this ritual. But the dream says nothing more ; the woma n hurries away with the child. This scene marks the turning point of the dream. It is mornin g again. Everything that was dark, black, primitive , and powerful in the last episode has been gathered together and symbolized by a magnificent Negro, wh o appears naked -i.e . real an d true. Just as darkness and bright morning—o r hot urine and cold snow—ar e opposites, so now the black ma n and the white landscape form a shar p antithesis. Th e four friends now must orient themselves within these new dimensions. A drinkin g vessel from ancient Peru, in the shape of a woman , reflects the feminine symbolis m of such containers, whic h occur s in Henry'sfina l dream. Their position has changed ; the way that led through Paris has brought them unexpectedly into French Switzerland (where Henry's fiancee came from). A transformation has taken place in Henr y durin g the earlier phase , when he was overpowered by unconscious contents of his psyche. Now, for the last time, he can begin to find his way forward from a place tha t was his fiancees home (showing tha t he accepts her psychological background). At the beginning he went from eastern Switzerland to Paris (from the east to the west, wher e the way leads into darkness, the unconsciousness). He has now mad e a turn of 180", toward the rising sun an d the ever-increasing clarity of consciousness. This way points to the middl e of Switzerland, to its capital. Berne, and symbolizes Henry's striving toward a center that would unite the opposites within him. T h e Negro is for some people the archetypa l image of "th e dark prima l creature " and thus a personification of certain contents of,the unconscious. Perhaps this is one reason why the Negro is so often rejected and feared by people of the white race. In him the white ma n sees his living counterpart, his hidden, dark side brought before his eyes. (This is just wha t most people try to avoid ; they want to cut it off and repress it.) Whit e men project onto the Negro the primitive drives, the archai c powers, the uncontrolled instincts that they do not want to admit in themselves, of which they are unconscious, and that they therefore designate as the corresponding qualities of othe r people. For a young ma n of Henry's age the Negro may stand on the one han d for the sum of all dark traits repressed into unconsciousness; on the othe r hand , he may represent the sum of his primitive, masculine strength and potentialities, his emotiona l and physical power. Tha t Henr y and his friends intend consciously to confront the Negro signifies therefore a decisive step forward on the way to manhood . In the meantime it has become noon, when the sun is at its highest, and consciousness has reached its greatest clarity. We might say that Henrv's ego has continued to become mor e and mor e compact, tha t he has enhance d his capa - 3 0 0 city consciously to mak e decisions. It is still winter, which ma y indicat e a lack of feeling and warmt h in Henry ; his psychic landscape is still wintry an d apparentl y intellectually very cold. Th e four friends are afraid tha t the naked Negro (being accustomed to a warm climate) might be frozen. But their fear turns out to be groundless, for after a long drive through deserted snow-covered country they stop in a strange city an d ente r a dark house. This drive and the desolate country is symbolic of the long and wearisome search for self-development. A further complication awaits the four friends here. Th e Negro and his servant are mute . Therefor e it is not possible to mak e verbal contac t with them; the four friends must seek othe r mean s to get in touch with the Negro. The y canno t use intellectual means (words) but rathe r a feeling gesture to approac h him. The y offer him a present as one gives an offering to the gods, to win their interest and their affection. And it has to be an object of our civilization, belonging to the values of the intellectual white man . Again a sacrificium intellectus is demande d to win the favor of the Negro, who represents natur e an d instinct. Henr y is the first to mak e u p his min d wha t to do. This is natural, since he is the beare r of the ego, whose prou d consciousness (or hybris) has to be humbled . He picks up a box of matche s from the floor and presents it "with deference" to the Negro. At first glance it may seem absurd tha t a small object lying on the floor and probably thrown away should be the prope r gift, but this was the right choice. Matche s are stored an d controlled fire, a means by which a flame can be lit and put out at anytime. Fire an d flame symbolize warmt h and love, feeling an d passion; they are qualities of the heart, found whereve r huma n beings exist. In giving the Negro such a present, Henr y symbolically combine s a highly developed civilized produc t of his conscious ego with the center of his own primitivity and male strength, symbolized by the Negro. In this way, Henr y can come into the full possession of his male sides, with which his ego must remain in constant touch from now on. This was the result. Th e six male persons — the four friends, the Negro, and his servant — are now together in a gay spirit at a communa l meal. It is clear tha t here Henry's masculine totality has been rounde d out. His ego seems to have found the security it needs to enable him consciously and freely to submit to the greate r archetypa l personality within himself, which foreshadows the emergenc e of the Self. Wha t happene d in the dream had its parallel also in Henry's waking life. Now he was sure of himself. Deciding quickly, he became serious abou t his engagement. Exactly nine months after his analysis had begun, he married in a little church of western Switzerland; and he left the following da y with his young wife for Canad a to take u p an appointmen t tha t he had received durin g the decisive weeks of his last dreams. Since then he has been living an active, creative life as the head of a little family and holds an executive position in a great industry. Henry's case reveals, so to speak, an accelerated maturatio n to an independen t and responsible manliness. It represents a n initiation into the reality of outer life, a strengthening of the ego an d of his masculinity, and with this a completion of the first half of the individuation process. Th e second half—which is the establishment of a right relationship between the ego and the Self—still lies ahead of Henry, in the second half of his life. Not every case runs such a successful and stirring course, and not every case can be handled in a similar way. O n the contrary, every case is different. Not only do the young and the old, or the ma n an d the woman , call for different treatment; so does every individual in all these categories. Even the same symbols requir e different interpretation in each case. I have selected this one because it represents an especially impressive exampl e of the autonomy of the unconscious processes and shows by its abundanc e of images the untiring symbol-creating powe r of the psychic background . It proves tha t the self-regulating action of the psyche (when not disturbed by too much rational explanation or dissection) can support the development process of the soul. 3 o i In Psychology and Alchemy Dr. Jun g discusses a sequence of over 100 0 dreams produce d by one man . The sequence revealed a striking number and variety of representations of the mandala motif—whic h is so often linked wit h the realization of the Self (see pp. 21 3 ff.). These pages present a fe w examples of mandala imagery from the dreams, to indicate the vastly different forms in whic h this archetype can manifest itseif, even in one individual's unconscious . The interpretative meanings offered here may, because of their brevity, seem to be arbitrary assertions. In practice no Jungia n woul d produce an interpretation of a dream withou t knowledg e of the dreamer and careful study of his associations to the dream. These interpretative statements must be taken as hints towar d possible meanings — nothin g more. Left: In the dream the anima accuses the ma n of being inattentive to her. A clock says five minutes to the hour. The man is being "pestered " by his unconscious : the tension thus created is heightened by the clock, by waitin g for somethin g to happen in five minutes. Below: A skull (whic h the ma n tries in vain to kick away ) becomes a red ball, then a woman' s head. Here the ma n may try to reject the unconsciou s (kicking the skull), but it asserts itself by means of the ball (perhaps alluding to the sun) and the anima figure. Left: In part of a dream, a prince places a diamon d ring o n the fourth finger of the dreamer's left hand. The ring, wor n like a weddin g ring, indicates that the dreamer has taken a "vow " to the Self. Belo w left: A veiled woma n uncover s her face, whic h shines like the sun. The image implies an illumination of the unconsciou s (involvin g the anima ) — quite different from conscious elucidation. Below: From a transparent sphere containin g small spheres, a green plant grows . The sphere symbolizes unity: the plant, life and growth . Below: Troops, no longer preparing for war, for m an eight-rayed star and rotate to the left. This image perhaps indicates that some inner conflic t has given wa y to harmony . Conclusion: M.-L. von Franz Science and the unconscious In the preceding chapters C. G.Jun g an d some of his associates have tried to make clear the role played by the symbol-creating function in man's unconscious psyche an d to point out some fields of application in this newly discovered area of life. We are still far from understandin g the unconscious or the archetype s — those dyna - mic nuclei of the psyche — in all their implications. All we can see now is tha t the archetypes have an enormous impac t on the individual, forming his emotions an d his ethical an d menta l outlook, influencing his relationships with others, and thus affecting his whole destiny. We can also see tha t the arrangemen t of archetypa l symbols follows a patter n of wholeness in the individual, and tha t an appropriat e understanding of the symbols can have a healing effect. And we can see tha t the archetypes can act as creative or destructive forces in our mind : creative when they inspire new ideas, destructive when these same ideas stiffen into conscious prejudices tha t inhibit further discoveries. Jun g has shown in his chapte r how subtle and differentiated all attempts at interpretation must be, in orde r nott o weaken the specific individual and cultural values of archetypa l ideas an d symbols by leveling them out--i.e . by giving them a stereotyped, intellectually formulated meaning.Jun g himsclfdedicated his entire life to such investigations and interpretative work; naturally this book sketches only an infinitesimal part of his vast contribution to this new field of psychological discovery. H e was a pioneer and remained fully awar e tha t an enormous numbe r of further questions remained unanswered and call for further investigation. This is why his concepts and hypotheses are conceived on as wide a basis as possible (without making them too vague and all-embracing) and why his views form a so-called "ope n system" tha t does not close the door against possible new discoveries. To Jung , his concepts were mere tools or heuristic hypotheses tha t might help us to explore the vast new area of reality opened up by the discovery of the unconscious— a discovery tha t has not merely widened our whole view of the world but has in fact doubled it. We must always ask now whethe r a menta l phenomeno n is conscious or unconscious and , also, whethe r a "real " outer phenomeno n is perceived by conscious or unconscious means. T h e powerful forces of the unconscious most certainly appea r not only in clinical material but also in the mythological, religious, artistic, a n d all the othe r cultura l activities by which m a n expresses himself. Obviously, if all men have commo n inherited patterns of emotional and menta l behavior (which Jun g called the archetypes), it is only to be expected tha t we shall find their products (symbolic fantasies, thoughts, and actions) in practically every field of huma n activity. Importan t moder n investigations of man y of these fields have been deeply influenced by Jung's work. For instance, this influence can be seen in the study of literature, in such books as J. B. Priestley's Literature and Western Man, Gottfried Diener's Fausts Weg zu Helena, or Jame s Kirsch's Shakespeare's Hamlet. Similarly, Jungia n psychology has contributed to the study of art, as in the writings of Herbert Rea d or of Aniela Jaffe, Erich Neumann's examina - tion of Henr y Moore , or Michae l Tippett's studies in music. Arnold Toynbee's work on history and Paul Radin's on anthropology have benefited from Jung's teachings, as have the contributions to sinology mad e by Richar d Wilhelm, Enwin Rousselle, an d Manfred Porkert. Soun d waves , given off by a vibrating steel disk and made visible in a photograph , produce a strikingly mandala-like pattern 304 Of course, this does not mea n tha t the special features of art an d literatur e (including their interpretations) can be understood only from their archetypa l foundation. Thes e fields all have their own laws of activity; like all really creative achievements, they cannot ultimately be rationally explained. But within their areas of action one can recognize the archetypa l patterns as a dynami c backgroun d activity. An d one can often deciphe r in them (as in dreams) the message of some seemingly purposive, evolutionary tendency of the unconscious. T h e fruitfulness of Jung's ideas is mor e imme - diately understandabl e within the are a of the cultura l activities of man : Obviously, if the archetype s determin e our menta l behavior, they must appea r in all these fields. But, unexpectedly, Jung's concepts have also opened u p new ways of looking at things in the realm of the natura l sciences as well—for instance, in biology. T h e physicist Wolfgang Pauli has pointed out that, due to new discoveries, our idea of the evolution of life requires a revision tha t might take into account an area of interrelation between the unconscious psyche an d biological processes. Until recently it was assumed tha t the mutatio n of species happene d at random an d tha t a selection took place by means of which the "meaningful, " well-adapted varieties survived, and the others disappeared. But moder n evolutionists have pointed out tha t the selections of such mutations by pur e chanc e would have taken muc h longer tha n the known age of our plane t allows. Jung's concept of synchronicity ma y be helpful here, for it could throw light upo n the occurrence of certain rar e "border-phenomena, " or exceptional events; thus it might explain how "meaningful " adaptation s an d mutations could happe n in less time tha n tha t required by entirely random mutations. Toda y we know of man y instances in which meaningful "chance " events have occurred whe n an archetype is activated. For example , the history of science contains man y cases of simultaneous invention or discovery. On e of the most famous of such cases involved Darwi n an d his theory of the origin of species: Darwi n ha d developed the theory in a lengthy essay, an d in 1844 was busy expandin g this into a major treatise. Whil e he was at work on this project he received a manuscrip t from a young biologist, unknown to Darwin , name d A. R. Wallace . T h e manuscrip t was a shorter but otherwise parallel exposition of Darwin's theory. At the time Wallac e was in the Molucc a Islands of the Mala y Archipelago. He knew of Darwi n as a naturalist, but ha d not the slightest idea of the kind of theoretical work on which Darwi n was at the time engaged. In each case a creative scientist ha d independently arrived at a hypothesis tha t was to change the entire development of the science. A n d each ha d initially conceived of the hypothesis in an intuitive "flash" (later backed up by documentar y evidence). Th e archetype s thus seem to appea r as the agents, so to speak, of a creatio continua. (Wha t Jun g calls synchronistic events are in fact something like "acts of creation in time." ) Similar "meaningful coincidences " can be said to occur whe n there is a vital necessity for an individua l to know about, say, a relative's death , or some lost possession. In a grea t man y cases such information has been revealed by means of extrasensory perception. This seems to suggest tha t abnorma l random phenomen a m a y occur whe n a vital need or urge is aroused; a n d this in turn might explain why a species of animals, unde r grea t pressure or in grea t need, could produc e "meaningful " (but acausal) changes in its oute r materia l structure . But the most promising field for future studies seems (as Jun g saw it) to have unexpectedly opened u p in connection with the complex field of microphysics. At first sight, it seems most unlikely tha t we should find a relationship between psychology an d microphysics. Th e interrelation of these sciences is worth some explanation. T h e most obvious aspect of such a connection lies in the fact tha t most of the basic concepts of physics (such as space, time, matter, energy, continuum or field, particle, etc.) were originally intuitive, semi-mythological, archetypa l ideas of the old Greek philosophers — ideas tha t 306 then slowly evolved and became mor e accurat e and tha t today ar e mainly expressed in abstract mathematica l terms. The idea of a particle, for instance, was formulated by the fourth-century B.C . Greek philosopher Leucippus and his pupil Democritus, who called it the "atom " i.e. the "indivisible unit. " Thoug h the atom has not proved indivisible, we still conceive matte r ultimately as consisting of waves and particles (or discontinuous "quanta") . T h e idea of energy, an d its relationship to force an d movement, was also formulated by early Greek thinkers, and was developed by Stoic philosophers. The y postulated the existence of a sort of life-giving "tension " (tonos), which supports and moves all things. This is obviously a semi-mythological germ of our modern concept of energy. Even comparatively moder n scientists and thinkers have relied on half-mythological, archetypal images when building up new concepts. In the 17th century, for instance, the absolute validity of the law of causality seemed "proved " to Ren e Descartes "b y the fact that God is immutabl e in His decisions and actions. " And the great Germa n astronome r Johanne s Kepler asserted tha t there arc not mor e and not less than three dimensions of space on account of the Trinity. These are just two example s amon g man y that show how even our moder n an d basic scientific concepts remained for a long time linked with archetypa l ideas tha t originally came from the unconscious. The y d o not necessarily express "objective " facts (or at least we cannot prove tha t they ultimately do) butsprin g from innate menta l tendencies in ma n — tendencies tha t induc e him to find "satisfactory" rational explanatory connections between the various oute r an d inner facts with which he has to deal. Whe n examinin g natur e and the universe, instead of looking for and finding objective qualities, "ma n encounters himself," in the phrase of the physicist Werne r Heisenberg. Because of the implications of this point of view, Wolfgang Pauli an d othe r scientists have begun to study the role of archetypa l symbolism in the realm of scientific concepts. Pauli believed tha t we should parallel our investigation of oute r objects with a psychological investigation of the inner origin of our scientific concepts. (This investigation might shed new light on a far-reaching concept to be introduced later in this chapter—th e concept of a "one-ness " between the physical and psychological spheres, quantitative and qualitative aspects of reality.) Besides this rathe r obvious link between the psychology of the unconscious and physics, there, are othe r even mor e fascinating connections. Jun g (working closely with Pauli) discovered that analytical psychology has been forced by investigations in its own field to create concepts tha t turned out later to be strikingly similar to those created by the physicists when confronted with microphysical phenomena . On e of the most importan t amon g the physicists' concepts is Niels Bohr's idea of complementarity. Moder n microphysics has discovered tha t one can describe light only by mean s of two logically opposed but complementar y concepts: Th e ideas of particle and wave. In grossly simplified terms, it might be said tha t unde r certain experimenta l conditions light manifests itself as if it were composed of particles; unde r others, as The America n physicist Mrs. Maria Mayer, wh o in 196 3 shared the Nobel prize for physics Her discovery — concernin g the constituent s of the atomi c nucleus — wa s made like so many other scientific discoveries: in an intuitive flash of insight (sparked by a colleague's chance remark). Her theory indicates that the nucleus consists of concentri c shells: The innermost contains tw o protons or tw o neutrons, the next contains eight of one or the other, and so on throug h wha t she calls the "magic numbers"—20 , 28, 50, 82.1 26 There is an obviou s link betwee n this model and the archetypes of the sphere and of number s 3<>7 if it were a wave. Also, it was discovered that we can accurately observe either the position or the velocity of a subatomi c particle - but not both at once. Th e observer must choose his experimenta l set-up, but by doing so he excludes (or rathe r must "sacrifice") some othe r possible setup and its results. Furthermore , the measuring apparatu s has to be included in the description of events because it has a decisive but uncontrollable influence upon the experimenta l set-up. Pauli says: "Th e science of microphysics, on account of the basic 'complementary ' situation, is faced with the impossibility of eliminating the effects of the observer by determinabl e correctives and has therefore to abando n in principle any objective understandin g of physical phenomena . Wher e classical physics still saw 'determined causal natura l laws of nature ' we now look only for 'statistical laws' with 'primar y possibilities.' " In other words, in microphysics the observer interferes with the experiment in a way tha t cannot be measured and tha t therefore cannot be eliminated. No natura l laws can be formulated, saying "such-and-such will happe n in every case. " All the microphysicist can say is "such-and-such is, according to statistical probability, likely to happen. " This naturally represents a tremendou s problem for our classical physical thinking. It requires a consideration, in a scientific experiment, of the menta l outlook of the participant-observer: It could thus be said tha t scientists can no longer hope to describe any aspects of oute r objects in a completely "objective " manner. Most moder n physicists have accepted the fact that the role played by the conscious ideas of an observer in every microphysical experiment cannot be eliminated; but they have not concerned themselves with the possibility tha t the total psychological condition (both conscious and unconscious) of the observer might play a role as well. As Pauli points out, however, we have at least no a priori reasons for rejecting this possibility. But we must look at this as a still unanswered and an unexplored problem. Bohr's idea of complementarity is especially interesting to Jungia n psychologists, for Jun g saw that the relationship between the conscious a n d unconscious mind also forms a complementary pair of opposites. Each new content that comes u p from the unconscious is altered in its basic natur e by being partly integrated into the conscious mind of the observer. Even dream contents (if noticed at all) are in that way semi-conscious. And each enlargement of the observer's consciousness caused by dream interpretation has again an immeasurabl e repercussion and influence on the unconscious. Thus the unconscious can only be approximately described (like the particles of microphysics] by paradoxica l concepts. Wha t it really is "in itself" we shall never know, just as we shall never know this abou t matter. T o take the parallels between psychology and microphysics even further: Wha t Jun g calls the archetypes (or patterns of emotiona l and mental behavior in man) could just as well be called, to use Pauli's term, "primar y possibilities" of psychic reactions. As has been stressed in this book, there are no laws governing the specific form in which an archetype might appear. Ther e are only "tendencies " (see p. 67) that, again, enable us to say only that such-and-such is likely to happe n in certain psychological situations. As the American psychologist William Jame s once pointed out, the idea of an unconscious could itself be compare d to the "field" concept in physics. We might say that, just as in a magnetic field the particles entering into it appea r in a certain order, psychological contents also appea r in an ordered way within tha t psychic area which we call the unconscious. If we call something "rational " or "meaningful " in our conscious mind, and accept it as a satisfactory "explanation " of things, it is probabl y due to the fact tha t our conscious explanation is in harmon y with some preconscious constellation of contents in our unconscious. In other words, our conscious representations are sometimes ordered (or arrange d in a pattern) before they have become conscious to us. T h e 19th-century Germa n mathematicia n Karl Friedrich Gauss gives an exampl e of an experience of such an unconscious order of ideas: He 308 says tha t he found a certain rule in the theory of numbers "no t by painstaking research, but by the Grac e of God , so to speak. Th e riddle solved itself as lightning strikes, and I myself could not tell or show the connection between wha t I knew before, wha t I last used to experimen t with, an d wha t produced the final success." Th e French scientist Henri Poincar e is even mor e explicit abou t this phenomenon ; he describes how durin g a sleepless night he actually watched his mathematica l representations colliding in him until some of them "found a mor e stable connection. On e feels as if one could watch one's own unconscious at work, the unconscious activity partially becoming manifest to consciousness without losing its own character. At such moments one has an intuition of the difference between the mechanisms of the two egos. " As a final exampl e of parallel developments in microphysics and, psychology, we can consider Jung's concept of meaning. Wher e before men looked for causal (i.e. rational) explana - tions of phenomena , Jun g introduced the idea of looking for the meanin g (or, perhaps we could say, the "purpose"). Tha t is, rathe r than ask why something happene d (i.e. wha t caused it), Jun g asked : Wha t did it happe n for? This same tendency appears in physics: Man y modern physicists are now looking mor e for "connections " in natur e tha n for causal laws (determinism). Pauli expected tha t the idea of the unconscious would spread beyond the "narrow frame of therapeuti c use " an d would influence all natura l sciences tha t deal with general life phenomena . Since Pauli suggested this development he has been echoed by some physicists wh o are concerned with the new science of cyberne - tics— the comparativ e study of the "control " system formed by the brain an d nervous system and such mechanica l or electronic information and control systems as computers. In short, as the modern French scientist Oliver Costa de Beauregard has put it, science an d psychology should in future "ente r into a n active dialogue. " T h e unexpected parallelisms of ideas in psychology and physics suggest, as Jun g pointed out, a possible ultimat e one-ness of both fields of reality tha t physics and psychology study—i.e. a psychophysical one-ness of all life phenomena . Jun g was even convinced tha t wha t he calls the unconscious somehow links u p with the structur e of inorgani c matter—a link to which the problem of so-called "psychosomatic " illness seems to point. Th e concept of a unitarian idea of reality (which has been followed u p by Pauli an d Erich Neumann ) was called by Jun g the unus mundus (the one world, within which matte r an d psyche are not yet discriminated or separately actualized). He paved the way towar d such a unitaria n point of view by pointing out tha t an archetyp e shows a "psychoid " (i.e. not purely psychic but almost material) aspect whe n it appears within a synchronistic event— for such an event is in effect a meaningful arrangemen t of inne r psychic and outer facts. In othe r words, the archetype s not only fit into oute r situations (as anima l patterns of behavior fit into their surrounding nature); at bottom they tend to become manifest in a synchronistic "arrangement " tha t includes both matte r an d psyche. But these statements are just hints at some directions in which the investigation of life phenomen a might proceed. Jun g felt tha t we should first learn a grea t deal mor e abou t the interrelation of these two areas (matter and psyche) before rushing into too man y abstract speculations abou t it. T h e field tha t Jun g himself felt would be most fruitful for further investigations was the study of our basic mathematica l axiomata—which Pauli calls "primar y mathematica l intuitions, " and amon g which he especially mentions the ideas of an infinite series of numbers in arithmetic, or of a continuum in geometry, etc. As the German-bor n autho r Hanna h Arend t has said, "wit h the rise of modernity, mathematic s do not simply enlarge their content or reach out into the infinite to become applicabl e to the immensity of an infinite an d infinitely growing, expandin g universe, but cease to be concerned with appearanc e at all. The y are no longer the beginnings of philosophy, or the 'science' of Being in its true appearance , but become instead the science of the structur e of the 309 huma n mind. " (A Jungia n would at once add the question: Whic h mind ? Th e conscious or the unconscious mind? ) As we have seen with reference to the experiences of Gauss an d Poincare , the mathe - maticians also discovered the fact tha t our representations are "ordered " before we become awar e of them. B. L. van de r Waerden , who cites man y example s of essential mathematica l insights arising from the unconscious, concludes: ".. . the unconscious is not only able to associate a n d combine , bu t even to judge. Th e judgmen t of the unconscious is a n intuitive one, but it is unde r favorable circumstance's completely sure. " Amon g the man y mathematica l primar y intuitions, or a priori ideas, the "natura l numbers " seem psychologically the most interesting. Not only do they serve our conscious everyday measuring an d counting operations; they have for centuries been the only existing means for "reading " the meanin g of such ancient forms of divination as astrology, numerology, geomancy, etc. all of which are based on arithmetica l computatio n and all of,which have been investigated by Jun g in terms of his theory of synchronicity. Furthermore , the natura l numbers — viewed from a psychological angle — must certainly be archetypa l representations, for we are forced to think abou t them in certain definite ways. Nobody, for instance, can deny tha t 2 is the only existing even primar y number, even if he has never thought abou t it consciously before. In othe r words, numbers are not concepts consciously invented by men for purposes of calculation: The y are spontaneous and autonomou s products of the unconscious — as are other archetypa l symbols. But the natura l numbers are also qualities adheren t to oute r objects: We can assert and count tha t there are two stones here or three trees there. Even if we strip oute r objects of all such qualities as color, temperature , size, etc., there still remains their "many-ness " or special multiplicity. Yet these same numbers are also just as indisputably parts of our own menta l set-up — abstrac t concepts tha t we can study without looking at outer objects. Numbers thus appea r to be a tangible connection between the spheres of matte r and psyche. According to hints droppe d by Jung , it is here tha t the most fruitful field of further investigation might be found. I mention these rathe r difficult concepts briefly in orde r to show that, to me, Jung's ideas do not form a "doctrine " but are the beginning of a new outlook tha t will continue to evolve a n d expand . I hope they will give the reade r a glimpse into wha t seems to me to have been essential to and typical of Jung's scientific attitude . He was always searching, with unusual freedom from conventiona l prejudices, and at the same time with grea t modesty and accuracy, to understan d the phenomeno n of life. He did not go further into the ideas mentioned above, because he felt tha t he had not yet enough facts in han d to say anythin g relevant about them—just as he generally waited several years before publishing his new insights, checking them again and again in the meantime , and himself raising every possible doub t abou t them. Therefore, wha t might at first sight strike the reade r as a certain vagueness in his ideas comes in fact from this scientific attitude of intellectual modesty- -an attitude tha t does not exclude (by rash, superficial pseudo-explanations and oversimplifications) new possible discoveries, and tha t respects the complexity of the phenomeno n of life. For this phenomeno n was always an exciting mystery to Jung . It was never, as it is for people with closed minds, an "explained " reality abou t which it can be assumed tha t we know everything. Creative ideas, in my opinion, show their value in that, like keys, they help to "unlock " hitherto unintelligible connections of facts and thus enabl e ma n to penetrat e deepe r into the mystery of life. I am convinced tha t Jung's ideas can serve in this way to find an d interpret new facts in man y fields of science (and also of everyday life), simultaneously leading the individual to a mor e balanced, mor e ethical, and wider conscious outlook. If the reade r should feel stimulated to work further on the investigation and assimilation of the unconscious— which always begins by working on oneself— the purpos e of this introductory book would be fulfilled. 3 1 0 Notes Approachin g th e unconsciou s C.

They show the nature and function of dreams; explore the symbolic meaning of modern art; and reveal the psychological meanings of the ordinary experiences of everyday life. They are a reinforcement to Jung's thought and an integral part of MAN AND His SYMBOLS. .. [Contemporary man] is blind to the fact that, with all his rationality and efficiency, he is possessed by 'powers' liiiu are beyond his control. His gods and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names. They keep him on the run with restlessness, vague apprehensions, psychological complications, an insatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food— and, above all, an impressive array of neuroses."
